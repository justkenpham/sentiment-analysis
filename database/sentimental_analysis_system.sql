It’s a nice true jet black and soft and fuzzy on the inside. It’s also a perfect weight - heavy enough to keep her warm on chilly days, but not heavy enough to weigh her down or make her roast when she wears it in class.

For years, I bought Jockey, which have always been a tad on the high side, price wise, but worth it, because they held up beyond expectations. That has not been the case for years, as the elastic fails, long before any noticeable wear to the fabric in the body of the shorts. In search for a better product, I discovered Fruit Of The Loom to be super affordable, decent quality, and very comfortable.

If they took away about 1-2 inches of fabric, these would fit much better. Finally, these are very thin and scratchy. Not the itchy type of scratchy, but almost rough.

They were about 1 inch bigger. Now after washing they are only maybe a 1/4 inch larger. Zero seam or waist band issues. Material is thick and very soft.

Each pair lasts about two years as I wear them every day at work, and they have always been extremely comfortable from the very stop with soft leather and very supportive insole and sole. Last week I went to purchase a pair and found that nobody in my area carries them any longer. I then ordered a pair online and found out why - this is NOT the same shoe. The leather was thinner and stiff, causing painful pressure my arthritic toe joint. The sole feels cheap and doesn\'t look like it would last very long. The finish of the shoe looks cheap and the upper was the worst. This looked like someone saw a pair once and tried to make a knock-off on a budget of about $10 (and I wouldn\'t pay that much for these!).','2016-12-18 13:05:00',1,0,9,51),(106,'I used to be a fan of Rockport shoes however, over the past two years, their workmanship has become poor. I think I can correlate this with their production move to another country. Don\'t get me wrong, neither was done in the United States, however, the most recent move has given them lousy quality. My shoes, are falling apart because whatever glue might be in there is not holding them anymore. I thought I would give him another chance, but I can\'t afford giving these chances anymore. My next purchase will not be a Rockport. I\'m sorry it has to be this way.','2018-08-10 13:10:00',1,0,10,51),(107,'This is my second pair of Rockport Eureka Walking Shoes. Both sets developed the same problems within six months of daily business use (mostly sitting behind a computer). The threads near the toe gave out and became unsightly in the right shoe of both pairs. The laces also separated (inner and outer) in both pairs. The newest pair shows cracking in the upper (which I had incorrectly thought was leather until reading these reviews) and the soles are developing separation from the rest of the shoe. Obviously the quality is not what I had expected of Rockport and I will not purchase this style again. I do find the shoes to be quite comfortable and helpful for my plantar fascitis, but for the price I expected them to be more durable. I\'ve attached two photos of the shoes after less than one year of use.','2017-01-16 13:15:00',3,0,11,51),(108,'I have been using this model for about 10 years. I worn out at least two pairs during that time. I loved the \"old\" model, which had an extremely comfortable sole (it felt literally like walking on air). However, I reached the point where my old Eurekas were falling apart and had to find replacements. I was very glad to find them in Amazon (particularly because they had the Wide version). Having used Eurekas f(in normal size 12) or so long, I did not hesitate to buy them (in fact I bought both brown and black versions). I was expecting the 12 W version to fit even better (I have wide feet) than the old 12 Normal. I was to be disappointed.','2016-09-30 13:20:00',2,0,12,51),(109,'The fit is perfect as usual, comfort is great, but the quality has truly gone down the tubes. I have exclusively worn this Rockport style shoe under the Eureka and the previous name( which escapes me) for over 10 years. I work in a business casual format where I need to dress well with the ability to climb ladders and walk in all types of terrain. I can honestly say I normally can where these shoes until the soles have worn out. The shoelaces usually break about 5 months into it, but you can buy those anywhere and I just replace both when one breaks. Broken shoelaces are not a big deal for comfort and longevity.','2016-02-05 13:30:00',1,0,13,51),(110,'My husband had worn this shoe for years and has owned 2,3 or maybe more pairs.

I was having knee pains from previous shoes and was looking for something with good ratings on being a good comfortable walking shoe. But, as many other reviews are stating at this point, they are made cheaply and are falling apart. I have had them now for right on 4 months. They are not just now starting to fall apart - they are reaching the point of complete failure. Both shoes have the glued on soles coming off with the left one almost half way off! Cheap glued on soles like most others now days - but it is obviously an inferior glue being used - not that any of the glue-on\'s seem that great. With the cost and the many other reviews having the same issue with apparently no recourse - I will be hunting for a different shoe to replace these.','2019-08-07 13:40:00',1,0,15,51),(112,'I purchased these shoes for my husband or Christmas.

It is past the return date because I bought them at Christmas but he just started wearing them in March! We always by rockport and are very disappointed in the quality of these shoes. For the money we paid they should last longer than a month and a 1/2 also he does not wear these to work, he wears his dress shoes to work so these are only worn on the weekends so basically barely worn!','2018-05-12 13:45:00',1,0,16,51),(113,'in 3 months rubber sole started to peel away from shoe.

A number of customers complained about the soles separating from the uppers after only a couple of months wearing them, and the same thing happened to the pair that I bought! It was a Winter day when I happened to walk through a slushy wet puddle from my driveway to my house. Within just a few minutes of the soles getting wet, the soles began flapping around as I walked! I\'ve already had these shoes beyond 90 days and so I was not able to return them for a full refund. The manufacturer must use a very poor quality rubber cement to stick the soles on. I even attempted to glue the soles back on with a number of different types of glue, and NOTHING worked. The soles continued to separate after a short time period. My expensive Rockport shoes ended up in my trash, and I will NEVER by any Rockport products again.','2020-05-01 13:55:00',1,0,1,51),(115,'Sadly, Rockport no longer uses cowhide in their shoes!

They stamp it with a leather pattern, but it cracks, and losses it\'s \"bond\" in a very short time ) I had been purchasing this model for over 20 years, and each pair lasted a year of moderate wear. The latest pair I purchased started cracking within a week, and the stitching was coming apart at the toe almost immediately.
