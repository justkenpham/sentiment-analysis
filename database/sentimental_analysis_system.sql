The leather was thinner and stiff, causing painful pressure my arthritic toe joint. The sole feels cheap and doesn\'t look like it would last very long.

I placed my existing AT&T Sim Card in it and it worked beautifully.Pros of this Phone:1) This phone has the longest BATTERY LIFE of any cellphone that I\'ve ever owned. In the past I\'ve used \"Renewed\" Samsung Note Phones and the AT&T A71 5G Phone. They had up to about 8 hours of heavy use battery life.The A52 5G gives me 12 hours of HEAVY use BATTERY Life and I still have 15 percent left.2) The phone is very fast, no lagging ever.3) The screen is very sharp and clear. The brightness have 800 Nits maximum brightness so it is easy to read this phone in Direct Sunlight.4) WiFi, Data and More...This phone easily connects to WiFi and its very fast. I own a 5ghz/2.4Ghz AT&T Dual Band Router and when I\'m close to the Router, I get the 5GHz at 533mps...lightning fast! However, in the back of my home, it switches to 2.4Ghz, but it is still fast enough.** If you have an older 2.4Ghz Router this phone will receive WiFi plenty fast enough.** Data...have a AT&T 40.00 Monthly Plan with 15GB of Data  it shows 5Ge, and it gets the faster Band 66 most if the time...very  very fast! There is no 5G where I live yet, however in a few months, it will have 5G here, this is the main reason why I purchased this 5G phone.Camera is superb, it has 10 x Magnification. The pictures come out clear and sharp.5) It has a 3.5 Headset Jack and a SD Card Slot. The Flagship Samsung phones don\'t give you a 3.5 Jack, and some of the  Flagship Phones don\'t give you an SD Card Slot.Cons...Just one MINOR Con, It doesn\'t give you a built in S Pen, however, I purchased a Disc Style Stylus that writes similar to the Samsung S Pen, so now I can use Samsung Notes for my handwritten notes.* Update November 8  2021...This phone is still very fast on my home WiFi or AT&T Data. I\'m so happy that I purchased this phone!I highly recommend this phone.','2021-12-18 19:29:38',5,19,401),(211,'  I was thinking about knocking off a star because it would say to restart because the Micro SD card was removed when it wasn\'t. Even just sitting on a table it would say that. Most forums said it happened after the April update.  My Micro SD card is fine and when the error comes up and check my pictures they are there. I\'m using a 3 year old Samsung 256GB EVO Micro SD card from my old phone. Will probably upgrade to 512GB soon now that google put limits on photo uploads.  I still use Amazon Prime to upload photos since they are still unlimited if you have a Prime account/subscription.  So my pictures will reside on the SD card and Amazon Photos. Amazon limits you on videos though.Update: I put in a Kingston 512GB card and haven\'t had the error since. I placed the 256GB EVO back in my old phone and it didn\'t have errors.  Maybe the card has to sit perfectly snug in the tray?For T-Mobile\'s 5G I got 275Mbps down, 100Mbps in my house. Outside of the house I get 347Mbps down and 137Mbps up using the speedtest.net app in LA. You can turn off 5G if you want to. It\'s in settings.  When you are on Wifi it disables 5G.Update: I now get 776Mbps down and 82Mbps up inside my house. T-mobile called the next week and offered 5G home internet for $50/mo.Battery life is really good compared to my old phone that had a SnapDragon 845.I started setting it up with WIndows 10 \"your phone\" app.  It allows you to manage notifications, messages, photos, and calls from Windwos 10 if the PC and phone are on the same local network (phone has to be on wifi, not cell data). It\'s a great way to copy and paste text messages and manage/copy photos from the phone to my computer. Then I noticed I could mirror the screen (interact with my phone from my computer) and use my phone\'s apps in Windows 10.  Some apps like some games won\'t work but I\'d say 90% of them do.  I tried to do the same with my wife\'s Pixel 4a but it wasn\'t there. I found out that it\'s only for the majority of Samsung phones and it\'s called link to Windows.  You can do the screen mirroring with 3rd party software with other android/iOS phones but this built in feature is very fast and seamless and high resolution.This phone is very similar to a Pixel 4a 5G. The Pixel 4a 5G has a very small advantage in pictures but not by much.  This A52 5G has better macro photos.  The Pixel 4a 5G has a much brighter screen if you use your phone a lot in direct sunlight.  I found the screen to be very good but I\'m not in the sun very much. I went from a 1440p screen to a 1080p screen and it\'s noticeable but I got used to it.The speed of running apps and games are very similar to my Snapdragon 845 phone but with longer battery life.  If you don\'t play a lot of 3D games then the processor is more than enough.Stereo speakers sound clearer. It won\'t replace my land line or work handset speakerphone just because they have larger speakers but it\'s good.Back to the camera it is very good.  Similar to a Pixel 4a 5G but Samsung has their own camera app and it\'s better. There are fun snapchat filters and AR (augmented realty) you can use without using the snapchat app.  Similar to using the snap camera app in Windows 10. Being able to change from close up to normal and widescreen are very seamless and handy.  I didn\'t to videos yet but examples on youtube show the stabilization on the Pixel 4a is a lot better so if you like to take 4K video while walking you should get something else. there is digital stabilization but you can only do that in 1080p.  Reminder, Google still gives Pixel owners unlimited photo uploads for now.The Samsung UI takes getting used to. I\'m used the Android One or just plain Android 11.  It has a few small things that are convenient that make it \"smarter\".  There are a lot of small things so you\'ll have to look at a review on the Samsung UI.I thought the punch hole selfie camera would bother me but my mind ignores it as it is on the side and small.  I only notice it when watching videos full screen but I often concentrate on the middle of the screen anyways.If you want unlimited photo/video storage, brighter screen, and slightly better camera performance get a Pixel 4a 5G. It\'s the same price.  If you like the link to Windows feature, better day time photos, keeping your media on a micro SDXC card then get the Samsung. I think the Samsung A52 5G will offer slightly better battery life.Only things in the box are a 15w charger, 4ft USB A to C cable, and SIM card ejection tool and some small manuals.  I think this comes with a 2 year Samsung warranty.  Both phones have the same IP waterproof rating. Something you usually don\'t find in mid-range phones.I can\'t say much about the fingerprint reader. I don\'t have many ridges let on my fingers so no sensor can accurately read my fingerprints. This affects heavy laborers and asians who don\'t have deep finger print ridges. It doesn\'t matter how accurate it is, it won\'t work if your ridges aren\'t deep enough. Even the expensive ones at work have a hard time.','2021-12-18 19:29:38',5,18,401),(212,'  EXPANDABLE STORAGE AND 3.5MM JACK I slept on this  phone the whole time I was shopping simply because I never liked Samsung\'s jank phones. But after scouring the market trying to find a phone that offered at least half the value they charged you for, I settled on the LG V60 (RIP LG phones), which wouldn\'t work on my network because of some bs proprietary technology (it seems like we\'re evolving backwards, innit?) It wasn\'t until I was going mad with rage at the consumer electronics market that I checked this phone out, and while I don\'t care for the UI, it\'s got all the hardware I need for an almost reasonable price. It basically cost the same as my G6 did, but comes with a better display and camera.Display is sweet, I like you can turn off 120hz to get more out of your battery, but I consistently run 120 with netflix, some social media-ing, and a fair amount of picture taking and the battery lasts me about a day and a half (I went to work with a full charge at 6am this morning, it\'s 11pm now and I\'ve got 45% left with me having binged watched netflix for at least a few hours while browsing the web)Camera isn\'t top of the line, but it is pretty dang crispy. Focus is fast, you can quickly adjust WB, has a fair amount of shooting modes and image processing. My biggest quirk is, and this may just be my eyes, but depth seems a bit off at times, like the background and foreground blend a bit. Night shooting is pretty clean, and has better zoom than any phone I\'ve owned, but don\'t expect magic from a quarter mile away haha video is a little shakey, I would\'ve liked to have seen more stabilization,  but I can deal with it.Comes with android 10 but you can download 11 off rip.One other thing I liked about this phone is there isn\'t a whole lot of bloatwear that you can\'t delete. Even most of Samsung\'s and Google\'s apps can be deleted, which is great because I don\'t want em hahaOther noteworthy things:MicroSD up to 1tbIP68 rating-i actually already accidentally tested this at it was sweet, so save your rice for cooking, kids.Kinda hard to find a sweet case for it, there is no classic defender otterbox :(It\'s wide and tall, but offset by not being very deep. Two hander if you\'ve got small hands though.Final thoughts:Samsung still sucks, and I\'ll forever miss LG phones, but the specs you get for the price are really unmatched for what\'s out there nowadays. I really don\'t understand why you\'d buy a $1300 flagship that has the same display, a slightly better camera, and no expandable storage, no audio jack, no IP rating, and an equal or lesser battery. In my eyes, this is the only phone worth getting in 2021. If I hadn\'t found it, I\'d have just gotten a talk and text phone for work and just chalked everything else because smart phones are becoming more and more of a ripoff each year, and this was a REALLY bad year for them. Price gouging, proprietary tech locking you up, consumers will be at the mercy of the industry until we reclaim our buying power and refuse to pay for overpriced garbage','2021-12-18 19:29:38',5,8,401),(213,'  Perfect i did a lot of research.

I ended up finding a Google Pixel 3 - which per Amazon\'s  \"Ask and Answer\" was reported to have supported WiFi calling.

When the Cricket SIM card, was inserted you immediately received message from Cricket telling you the phone is not compatible.

You need to contact customer service to reactive your account but the reactivation is temporary.  Your account will be suspended anytime as long as you are using the incompatible phone before Cricket shutdown its 3G and switch to VOLTE network in Feb. 2022. Cricket does sell its own compatible Samsung A32 5G.  It\'s called Samsung A32 5G SE edition.  The phone sold on Amazon has the same model number, but is not SE edition.

I mainly bought this not because of some sort of show-off or novelty, but because I wanted a phone that has bigger screen and easy to see and navigate when you use Amazon shopping, facebook or emails.  My eye sight isn\'t what it used to be when I was younger and I really needed a phone that has much bigger screen than traditional smart phone.That was the only reason for buying this expensive folding phone.As for the bigger screen, easy navigation, typing, reading...etc, it is absolutely great.  I do not have to use reading glasses, nor make the letters as big as possible.  For that, I would have given 5 stars.However, it has some other related issues.  Since it is a big phone, it is very heavy.  Also, since the screen is so big and also has another 6\" screen when it was folded, it uses up a lot of battery power and I can see it draining quite fast.  I guess that Samsung had to choose.  Make the phone bigger and heavier for bigger battery or make it as portable and slim as possible with less desirable battery life.It is a great phone for me and I am quite happy with it, but due to the weak battery life, I have to give 4 stars, instead of 5.','2021-12-18 19:29:44',4,5,403),(231,'  The phone is good overall,  but I like to point out some flaws.

One, and most obviously, was the price. At $599 ( the price on Amazon when I purchased it), it was an unbeatable deal. Another was the specs: Snapdragon 865 and 6gb of RAM was perfect for my needs. My old Galaxy S7 looked practically primitive when set against the S20 FE. And so, I decided to give a midrange phone a try.At first glance, the S20 FE seemed too good to be true. The screen, while not 4K, still looks great with the 120Hz refresh rate enabled. The rear cameras look incredibly good, nice and crisp. I\'ve done everything from web browsing and gaming to word processing and photography, all with minimal issue. Battery life is solid, but not the best in the market right now. You\'ll still be able to get a couple of days out of the S20 FE on 120Hz. Also, you can\'t beat the customizability of Android. With the option to install launchers/widgets plus a wealth of storage (and SD card support), you get a lot of choice with the S20 FE. The size, while much larger than I was used to, still fits in the hand really well. I would recommend getting a case and screen protector for this one though, as I have seen people shatter the screen with a single drop.But, if you\'ve been reading up on the S20 FE at all, then you know that there are problems. First off, the virtual proximity sensor on the phone is spotty at best. Testing it out myself, I had to be right on top of the sensor for it to detect my face. And for phone calls, that means a few more accidental muted/ended calls than usual. The face recognition and fingerprint scanner are also not great. I\'d say it works about 85% of the time, but when it doesn\'t, do you ever feel it. Adding on, the front-facing camera is pretty lackluster. Not bad, but it\'s not flagship levels by any stretch. You\'ll need to be in absolutely optimal lighting to get a decent picture out of it. So if you\'re looking for a phone to take selfies indoors with, I\'d look elsewhere.From what I\'ve seen, the standout complaint with the S20 FE is the touchscreen. And yes, my phone (ordered in early November) has the issue too. Pretty horrendous ghosting when testing it in the touchscreen test app. There\'s undeniably a hardware issue with the S20 FE. There have been updates since the phone released, but none have fixed it entirely; merely a band-aid on a bloody gash. The real question is: does it affect everyday use? Will you notice it every moment you use the S20 FE? The answer to both is no, at least for me. While I\'m sure it does affect certain tasks (most notably those that involve fast touches or 3+ fingers), I really haven\'t noticed it in actual use. Pinching/zooming with your fingers close together will cause the screen to jitter, but that\'s about all I\'ve seen. If that worries you enough to pass on the S20 FE, I don\'t blame you.It really is a shame that I can\'t give the S20 FE a perfect 5 stars, because it does deserve it in some aspects. But with these hardware issues, there\'s always the worry that time will make them worse. It\'s a genuine worry, I get that. But even with the problems, the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE is a pretty great phone. It really does feel like a flagship phone, but with a massive price cut and a few downgrades. Only time will tell if the problems the phone has will get worse, but for right now, I\'m more than happy with it.Edit (8/18/2021): I\'ve dropped my rating from 4 stars to 3 stars.It\'s been a little less than a year, and the issues mentioned above have started to affect daily use in a way that turns this from a great phone to an okay phone not worth your time. Okay, maybe not daily use, per se. But enough that it\'s starting to effect my initial thoughts on it.The amount of times this phone has turned on in my pocket because of ghost touches is insane. Every time I take it out of my pocket, it\'s opened a random app and input a few letters on the keyboard. And this is after adjusting the settings to stop these sorts of things. I turned off double tap to turn on (despite wanting that feature) and turned on accidental touch protection (which did absolutely nothing). I even made it so that the phone needed face recognition or a fingerprint to unlock every time I close it. But it just keeps happening. No software update really fixed the screen, as suspected. This is a pure hardware messup.Here\'s the cold, honest truth: the screen on the S20 FE is terrible. Worse than my old S7. Worse than even a budget android phone\'s screen. It\'s beyond comprehension. The virtual proximity sensor is also worthless. I almost want to give it the classic \"angry Amazon customer 1-star\" review, but I\'ll refrain. There\'s still good here with the chip, customizability, and great battery life, but that stuff can only get you so far.Here\'s my advice: don\'t bother with this phone. You can get a midrange smartphone for the same (or even a lower) price, with better specs. It\'s still not the worst thing out there and I\'m not tossing it in the trash just yet, but it\'s definitely the last Samsung product I\'ll be buying.

This effects everyday use in subtle but frustrating ways. From taps being read as scrolling to unplayable multitouch games, the screen makes me miss my 3 year old galaxy S8.

I thought about a Pixel 4a, but when I saw this phone in online comparisons and its 120hz screen, huge battery, and top-of-the-line processor for $600, that seemed like too good of a deal. While the OS is gussied up a bit from what\'s in the Pixel line, it\'s not hard to figure out the differences and it adds a slight premium feel.The only negatives in comparison to the Pixel are the camera software isn\'t as good, and the price is greater: $250 more than the 4a and $100 more than the 4a 5G. I had to look hard at my criteria to justify the extra cost, but I feel that the Pixel software doesn\'t add enough to the photos and that the extra cost gave me a phone with the kinds of features that will tide me over an additional year that the Pixel phones--with their weaker processors--likely would not.

Really stinks that an issue this big slipped through. Samsung has released 3 software updates trying to fix it, but still have problems with jittery scrolling, accidental touches, etc. This isn\'t something that can be fixed with an update in my opinion or it would be resolved by now. Look elsewhere, or if your brave chance it I guess. I thought I would get lucky despite all the bad reviews/complaints (check samsung forums). I don\'t mean to be a downer but I strongly advise to choose a different phone. I\'m still looking myself. Good luck!','2021-12-18 19:29:45',1,17,404),(249,'  Took the phone to a Verizon store as soon as I received it and after 30 minutes of the rep trying to activate it he called Verizon tech support and was told the phone had no registered ESN and could not be activated on their network. The phone also appeared to have been used as it had scratches in the end and was missing the sim card key. Am returning the phone.','2021-12-18 19:29:45',1,3,404),(250,'  I did extensive research to find this Valet, which is extra-special. It both met and exceeded my expectations, and is truly worth the money. My son is now leaving on his own to pursue manhood. I wanted to give him a few fine gifts that would be practical, yet meaningful, that he would always have and use and perhaps pass down. This was one of those gifts that I was proud to give him. It needed to be all real wood, to be large enough, and to have separate compartment areas to hold his keys, wallet, change purse, tie pins, cufflinks, personalized writing pen, watches, and fine jewelry, and it needed to have charging areas for his phone and other electric devices. I looked at many different ones, but was unsatisfied with the cheap quality of wood, and I disliked the \"open desk tray\" or \"kitchen drawer tray\" look of many. I was unhappy to pay $30-$60 on these \"cheaper\" products that had no unique craftsmanship and looked so dull and \"generic.\" Then I happened into this fine Mahogany valet and was instantly charmed. It has all the needed space for items described above, plus it has charging ports and space to place up to three electronic devices in it, such as his phone, charger, and gaming device or camera. We like the storage areas in the top and drawer, and my son was pleased to find that the back of it could be easily removed to \"hide\" a few extra small items, too. The finish is beautiful, and the top storage floor is crafted in a lovely and handsome design. Also, it is not too heavy or bulky, but is still built \"solid.\" My son was elated with it, and my husband looked a little jealous, giving me the idea of getting him one for our 28th anniversary. Obviously, anything this fine that I would buy multiple times is something I could recommend easily to anyone hunting for an attractive, high-quality crafted valet with rare design and a better-than run-of-the-mill design. When you find this jewel, consider your hunt over with! The valet quickly arrived, well-packaged and in good condition, and we have no complaints. Thank you!','2021-12-18 19:29:46',5,9,405),(251,'  Really disappointed in this item.  The item arrived damaged due to poor packaging for shipment, but even it it wasn\'t damaged, I would still return it.  It it not solid wood and the wood finish is barely that. It appears to be a very thin laminate over some other material. That was obvious with the damage on arrival where the corner was cracked off.  This charging station is pretty small in comparison to others and in my opinion not worth the price.  At $100 price point, I would have expected better quality or a more substantial item.  I\'ll be returning this and purchasing a much less expensive version.','2021-12-18 19:29:46',1,13,405),(252,'  This valet was beautiful. I was extremely happy with the product. I actually purchased 2 of them as gifts. My only issue was that it sat for over 2 weeks prior to shipping. I do absolutely understand that it was the holidays, but I paid for fast shipping. I was told I’d receive a refund for that shipping and a small discount. I never received the amount promised. I would definitely buy again and from the vendor, but not during the holidays.','2021-12-18 19:29:46',5,7,405),(253,'  Fell apart completely when removed from the box...Did not meet my expectations at all, I purchased as a gift and it arrived damaged and fell completely apart when they removed it from the box.','2021-12-18 19:29:46',1,12,405),(254,'  Excellent Design and solid wood material.

I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the trim (which is actually plastic) on the front of the drawer arrived with part of it unglued, revealing unfinished wood underneath.  The seller responded quickly to my concern and refunding 10% of purchase price. The trim can be re-glued, but I wish it wasn\'t plastic.','2021-12-18 19:29:46',4,20,405),(256,'  This is our second station, beautiful on the counter side by side!

Absolutely Gorgeous!!!','2021-12-18 19:29:46',5,12,405),(257,'  Great stylish option for bedside phone and tablet charging.Just add a USB charger in the back section and run your cord though to the phone.','2021-12-18 19:29:46',5,20,405),(258,'  Good, solid build quality. Needed a good cleaning after un-boxing because a bunch of packaging debris was stuck to the felt lining on the top shelf.

Don\'t expect the lock to be more than a decorative feature.','2021-12-18 19:29:46',4,17,405),(259,'  Absolutely love this charging Station! I wanted something that was attractive looking for all to see...I have been searching for one like this for years and finally found it! It\'s very solid not cheap!

I checked the status of the order multiple times a day until it finally arrived on 08/26/2021.  After the first 24 hours of owning the phone, however, I started slightly second guessing the decision as the battery life and camera are noticeable downgrades from my Galaxy 21.  I tried the leather Samsung cover, and while I liked it because it made the phone feel more like a wallet, it was a little more bulky than I had hoped.Then this case arrived, and I\'m back in love with the Z Flip 3.  If Samsung had including this carbon fiber cover in the first place they would have sold 2x as many Z Flip 3\'s.  It looks awesome, fits seamlessly, has a tacky - but not too tacky - feel to it so I don\'t throw the phone across the room when I flip it open with one hand and it is super thin.  Yes, it\'s pricey, but it really \"makes\" the phone','2021-12-18 19:29:48',5,1,406),(261,'  I had previously bought another case for the Z Flip 3 and sent it back. When folding the phone the case was way too thick (it basically doubles the thickness of the case when folded). This case however is very thin yet provides good protection. I dropped the phone from 2 to 3 feet and no issues. Its thin, light weight and gives the phone grippiness so it doesn\'t slip out of your hand. Yes it\'s expensive but bottom line is it works great with the Z Flip 3 and you will never want or need another case.','2021-12-18 19:29:48',5,19,406),(262,'  The other 5-star reviews said it best, but be careful selecting a USB-C chord with this case, if the end that plugs into the phone has too much wrapper/padding around the actual plug, the case may prevent a snug fit and you may end up pushing the phone out of the bottom piece of the case.Had to switch out cable in my car (worked fine with the Samsung S21 Ultra Case)','2021-12-18 19:29:48',5,19,406),(263,'  Love this case. Snaps on both top and bottom snugly. I have not had any issue with it moving at all, and I have not even used the sticky tape yet. Great feel in the hand, smooth yet grippy. Very slim but good protection with total coverage on all corners. What I like the best is the smooth edges where the cutouts are. My fingers don\'t get sore or scratched while holding on to text like my purple one. Yes it is expensive but I think the slim profile along with all I have mentioned makes it worth it.  Would definitely buy again. All cutouts are perfect and fingerprint scanner is fully accessible.','2021-12-18 19:29:48',5,4,406),(264,'  As you\'d expect, since it was made by Samsung, this case fits like a glove.  It has a nice feel in the hand.However, there is no hinge protection when phone is closed, which is definitely a drawback compared to other cases like Spigen.  Also, the case is so thin that, while I\'m sure it protects against scratches, I can\'t imagine there\'s much protection against shock from drops.','2021-12-18 19:29:48',3,18,406),(265,'  The texture of the case is nice and grippy. The carbon fiber look gives it a sleek and elegant demeanor that you can show off everyday or at a nice dinner. The cutouts expose the volume button and power button completely, which I\'m fine with. It\'s just a little different from cases that cover the volume buttons like the Samsung Leather case. In it\'s open state, the case doesn\'t really provide that much protection to the screen since it lacks substantial raised edges but if I ever drop it, the phone will probably be closed anyway. All in all, its a really durable material thin case that provides great elegance.','2021-12-18 19:29:48',5,3,406),(266,'  The case fits great and barely adds any extra size to the phone. It has good grip but still slides in and out of my pocket easily. The only reason I didn\'t give 5 stars is because the corner of the case was damaged out of the box. I would try to exchange but I don\'t feel like going through the trouble and there\'s currently none in stock. I\'m likely going to add more scuffs and scrapes overtime but it would\'ve been nice to get one that wasn\'t already prescuffed.','2021-12-18 19:29:48',4,8,406),(267,'  Likes:Feels good picking up - doesn\'t slipFits phone snuglyProtects phoneDislikes:Only comes in black so hides phone colorpriceyOverall: Would recommend if OK with price','2021-12-18 19:29:48',5,14,406),(268,'  This is the best case ever for the Galaxy flip phone.It does everything right.','2021-12-18 19:29:48',5,10,406),(269,'  Tried the leather cover it was bad this was is the best by far great feel and holds in place.','2021-12-18 19:29:48',5,12,406),(270,'  I got the case yesterday and the ring that comes with it came off not more than 3 hours later.

Ive had on my phone for about a week and a half and so far its MEH. The ring is literally just there for you have extra grip on the phone when walking. Other than that, its useless as a kickstand. The case is very slippery and not easy to hold onto without the ring. Love this phone, just wish buying a case wasn\'t so difficult.

I will say, the top peice is a little more tricky to get to snap into place. But once it\'s in place it stays in place, and can be tricky to take off. I just really like the ring. It makes me feel like I\'m safe from dropping my phone. Overall I think this case is a good choice.

This phone is already durable so it doesn\'t need a beefy case. This makes it grippy and doesn\'t add any bulk. It also fills the gap in the fold nicely with a subtle raise on the screen.

The phone was not brand new!!!! someone have already manipulated it!!! There was not protector film on the inner screen, the protector film on the outer screen was off set really bad and the device came folded inside its packaging!!! (it comes unfolded from manufacturing) and last but not least, when inspecting the lid of the box I could notice that someone did some hand cutting inside in order to make the lid fit with the phone folded... This is extremely disappointing, not sure who to blame either Motorola or Amazon!!! I received no headset as well','2021-12-18 19:29:55',4,9,410),(290,'  I have been waiting a long time for a \"flagship\" moto.  Really, I have missed Moto so much that I just wanted a OLED moto w/ a headphone jack.  But the Edge seemed to check a lot off my list.  Unfortunately I have been dismayed with what I received...  NO OPTION FOR WIFI CALLING.  :( ... a few perplexing things on Moto\'s part.-Buggy out of box -OS must have froze/shutdown several times trying to do normal setup-Case provided falls off phone-Case way to large to fit on phone. Basically useless. Falls off if you go to grab phone by case. More dangerous than not having one at all-Finger zoom-For some reason I cannot zoom on normal pictures, text, ect. Very odd. I have an LG, several Motos and a XIOAMI phones next to me where I am able to zoom in apps, web pages where the Edge I cannot. I don\'t understand this at all-NO OPTION ANYWHERE FOR WIFI CALLING- This may be the dealbreaker. I have LOTS of android phones including about five Motos (going back to G4) and they all at least have the option for Wifi calling (depends on carrier if it actually works) but the Edge does NOT even have it as an option. WHY MOTO, WHY???-I love gestures and they seem to work fine but what it the One Button Nav for?  It\'s still taking screen space but doesn\'t do anything? Very odd.If anyone is having these issues and it\'s human error - PLEASE LET ME KNOW - I really, truly hope my issues are human error, specifically the WIFI CALLING.  Please, anyone, let me know if you have any info regarding.  Thanks!UPDATE- After I sent this review, went on XDA and Motorola forums; I was told to root among other things.  I did notice the battery life from the time I took out of the box was not near as advertised.  After a few hours from a full charge I was on 20%.  I thought perhaps it was bc I was setting up, downloading apps, ect.  Day 2, I intentionally only started the phone, took SIM out and put in another for my driver that day (No wifi calling with ATT so cannot use at work).  Phone just say on my desk all day and with a full charge, by 3pm it was down to 40% - NOT BEING USED.Then yesterday I noticed the screen developing a purple \"bruise\" on the side.  It kept flickering and eventually grew so much it went into my main screen.So, this phone has been a complete mess since taken out of this box.Thankfully Amazon made it simple for me to get a replacement which I did.  I truly hope I received a lemon.If my replacement has the same type issues, then....I will update.','2021-12-18 19:29:55',1,14,410),(291,'  So just like the reviewer before me, when I opened the box the clamshell was closed and the sticker was lazly hanging on to the outer screen. \'Rushed\' would be the word I would use to describe how it looked if speaking to a blind man. But no scratches, dents or fingerprints. According to the Motorola unboxing the Razr is upright and presented nicely, not hastily thrown in a box and shipped.As for the phone itself: Awesome. I am so far happy with my purchase. I preferred this color over the the blush and mercury (att only) because those colors look 2 tone. Meaning, top half (second screen) is different color than the body. This graphite color blends in nicely with it\'s black top half.Call quality has been great so far. At the other end they told me they could hear a definite difference (galaxy s9). I also got to do a video conference, smooth baby smooth. Thankfully I did not misplace the usb to 3.5 jack.....yetThe phone feels a little stiffer (opening clamshell) than what I was picturing in my head. I thought back to the days of the V3 and this 5g version flirts with feeling. Genie, I wish for this to have a ui option that looks like the old V3 layout when making a call..Genie,Christina?? Update: I found it.I like having a satisfying [snap] when I end a call. I don\'t get that from [push the red button].It is like those new Chevy BelAirs that you can only get from certain mechanic shops. New chassis, modern technology, old great lines body style. This phone is made to kick up the nostalgia and it will \'roadhouse\' kick you and everyone around it. That is...if you had a Razr 15 years ago. But so far, I have been given complements and younger people want to know more information on the second screen; when they see me typing and watching YT on it.Battery: I\'ve only had phone for a few hours. Would it be nice, yes but I rate it \'eh, don\'t bother me\'. If your a heavy user, check the professional reviewers.Setup was easy however I did not finish it yet. I\'m like mostly through it. Android 10 is easy to work with. Cradling the phone in my hand(s) feels nice while I type (or swipe) on the keyboard. FP scanner integrated into Motorola symbol is a nice and refreshing touch.Pictures: The first is the speed test. 6pm on a Monday in Vegas. 5gE. The others are some taken around town. No filters, just normal and pro mode. I did try \'enhance\' on one and crop photo on two. I am not a picture guy so again try a professional review if that\'s your thing. Oh an animated smiley face on the second screen is a nice little touch.Scrolling: You can feel a little divot/bump/indent when your finger hits the middle of be the screen but it\'s barely noticeable unless you want to find it.Thanks for reading, AMA if your on the fence.','2021-12-18 19:29:55',3,17,410),(292,'  Unbelievable. Received the phone in the same conditions as described in other reviews. Folded, with no film on inside screen and crooked film on outside screen. The screen shows very distinct marks from foldings. But besides packaging issues, the primary reason that convinced me to return the device, that I haven\'t so far read in other reviews, is that the screen squeaks when opening and closing. It seems that the cheaper US price may be justified by a batch with subpar level of quality. I cannot believe the Motorola guys are setting themselves up for failure again after the poor device they launched last year. Very disappointed given all the anticipation and purchase on day of launch. One star is being generous for such an expensive device.','2021-12-18 19:29:55',1,20,410),(293,'  UPDATE 5 (8/26/2020): Ultimately, a return.It\'s sad to say but I am returning this phone. While it was replaced by motorola the screen is starting to exhibit a graininess or splotchy issue at low light. I just can\'t trust this phone nor it\'s screen to last past the year warranty. The edge is also not something that I can really put up with long term. Watching videos just doesn\'t feel right on a curved screen.Maybe this phone is for you, maybe I got two duds. Either way enjoy what you like but keep an eye out on your own device.UPDATE 4 (8/17/2020): Patience is strong with this phoneThe replacement phone that Motorola sent me does not have any screen issues 6 days later. People are reporting that the issues usually occur within the first 2 - 3 days so I think as long as it doesn\'t show any issues after a week you may be ok. It\'s still very hard to swallow a potential screen issue at the full retail price or any price for that matter. For those of us that purchased it at the discounted rate when it first launched, It is a good value still to me.However, if you need a phone that does phone things and are not a power user or don\'t really care about 5g (Which you shouldn\'t really unless it helps your coverage in rural area\'s), the Pixel 4a is my recommended pick. Or wait til the Pixel 4a 5g comes out which should have the same chipset.UPDATE 3 (8/11/2020): The dawn of a new phoneWell Motorola overnighted me a new a phone. You can see the difference in the screen quality. We\'ll see if the new phone experiences the same issue. Should start showing after a few days of use.UPDATE 2 (8/10/2020): The Motorola Replacement SagaI reached out to Motorola about the phone issue. There are A LOT of reports of the green tint issue on the screen on low light. It\'s possible the first batch is faulty so if you do get a replacement from Amazon directly it may not be better. Hopefully the replacement phone has a fixed screen, however if the 2nd replacement is faulty this will be returned to Amazon for a refund. People are reporting if you\'re ok in the first 3 - 4 days your screen is fine but this is just... not acceptable for the price.UPDATE 1 (8/5/2020): (Keeping original review below this)After using this phone for little more over four days, it is exhibiting issues similar to the Moto Edge + with the display. The display has a green tint to it at night under low light conditions. It\'s almost like a green haze and it\'s the upper half of the display (See attached photo). This makes sense as it uses the same display panel as the Moto Edge + which also has the green tint issue on some devices. If you encounter this issue it\'s possible it could be fixed via software but I would request a new device through Amazon or Motorola or just return it.(Original review):TL;DR - If you like to listen to music through bluetooth, there is a quirky fix that you may need to do if the music sounds flat or is missing bass.If you enjoy listening to music through Bluetooth, this is a bit of a mixed bag. There is an app called Moto Audio that always has an EQ and some weird tuning for any audio output through Bluetooth. It makes music sound incredibly tinny and flat and just plain awful. USB-C adapters or headphones plugged into the headphone jack disables this EQ however. There may be an option to disable the Moto Audio for bluetooth in the app itself, but the EQ may still remain. To fix this, plug in a pair of headphones either through the headphone jack or the USB-C port, and then unplug it and go back to your Bluetooth. The sound should be back to it\'s full and normal sound. Not sure if I got a weird bug but it the EQ continued to persist on my phone even with it being disabled initially.Otherwise it\'s a very nice phone. The screen is pretty vibrant and the 90hz refresh rate is nice. VoLTE and WiFi calling are working on T-Mobile through Straight Talk which is great. You\'ll be able to use this phone when T-Mobile phases out 3G calling starting on Jan 1st 2020. Also getting a 5G signal which is cool.No issues with the finger print sensor, works well with a screen protector (plastic) applied. The supplied case is nice as well since there are limited options available for this phone.The speakers are quite nice and loud too, music sounds pretty clean through them.With phones becoming more and more expensive, this is a pretty nice phone for the price. Sure there are cheaper phones but the 5G support, 765G Chipset, headphone jack, some water resistance and the design, I\'d say this is a good mid-high range phone.','2021-12-18 19:29:55',1,20,410),(294,'                    The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\n   ***UPDATE 9/12/20 FOLLOWING MULTIPLE REPLACEMENT FAILURES***Back when the Samsung S7 Edge came out, I wanted it so badly - but couldn\'t afford it. A few years later and my current LG V20 is starting to get a little slow, and a new EDGE is available for $500 (presale price)? I\'m all over this! Both of my parents bought it as well (they were both using the Samsung S7 - not the Edge version - which at this point are largely unusable), so I have three separate experiences with the exact same phone to compare. NOW ACTUALLY FIVE AS OF 9/12/20.Initial physical setup was a breeze. The SIM card slot (which also houses the SD card, if you have one) pops right out with an enclosed pin. The SIM and SD card connector faces the back of the phone. Slide it right in, and you\'re all done. The phone booted up just fine, and was at about 70% charge when I received it. It\'s a BEAUTIFUL phone, with vibrant colors and VERY smooth operation of the screen. I miss the app drawer, but I can live without it.Initially I was unable to receive text messages on Verizon, although every other function worked perfectly in every way. All three Motorola Edges had the same problem - all on Verizon. After several days of troubleshooting, my dad reached level three tech support at Motorola, who tied in with level two tech support at Verizon, and they figured out that Verizon needed to \"check, un-check, and re-check\" \"something\" in our account settings in order for text messages to be received by our phones. Once Verizon completed this cycle, text messages were fully functional instantaneously for all three of us. I was hoping that was the only issue... alas, I was not so lucky.A few days later, the screen started to develop a purple \"bruise\" on the left side, as described by MANY other reviewers. The next morning it was back to normal, but by the end of the day it was doing it again, and was worse than the prior evening. The next morning it was back to normal again, but 30 minutes later the bruise showed up again.I called Motorola tech support that afternoon. I had some difficulty understanding the woman I spoke with due to her accent, but I understood the majority of what she said. I was told that software technicians are aware of the problem and are working on a patch in the lab, and that when it is done it will be pushed to the phones automatically. I asked for a timeline, and was informed that they cannot say - which makes sense because you don\'t want to open a liability door for misleading customers, but at the same time I really needed an answer in some form. No answer was to be had, though. This was two days ago.By that evening, the lower left part of the screen was entirely blacked out, the bruise had spread to covering most of the left half of the screen, and had started on the right side as well. The next morning it was better, but only half-way so. Again the phone was unusable by that evening - which was last night.This morning the phone had improved by maybe only 25-30%. By 1:30 pm, not only were parts of the screen blacked out, but the bottom of the screen started flashing white and was non-responsive to touch (see attached pictures and video).I completed a master reset on my Motorola Edge, but the problem still persisted even after the phone was erased. At that point, I requested a replacement from Amazon. Thankfully my LG V20 still works just fine, so I have a fully functional backup until the new phone arrived.As my dad says, such a high failure rate is unexpectedly high for a new product launch. OTHER than this debilitating screen issue, I LOVE the phone - as do both of my parents.--------------------FIRST EDITThe first phone lasted one week before the failure as described above. The replacement lasted two weeks before the \"bruise\" showed up. By this time my dad\'s Edge had also started to fail. My mom\'s Edge, however, is still going strong. So the failure rate is now 75% (two for me, and dad\'s).Review is demoted from 3 stars to 1. If the screen doesn\'t work, the phone doesn\'t work. The phone is otherwise literally perfect. But if you can\'t use it, then it doesn\'t work. Period. I returned the replacement for a full refund. I\'m heartbroken.--------------------SECOND EDITMy dad\'s replacement Edge lasted less than 2 weeks before that screen started to fail. Out of the FIVE Motorola Edge phones from me, my dad, and my mom, only my mom\'s has yet to develop screen failure. That is a whopping EIGHTY PERCENT failure rate. Both me and my dad have reverted back to our old phones, and will be shopping for a new NON-Motorola midrange phone soon.','2021-12-18 19:29:55',2,13,410),(295,'  Yes unbelievable. Received the phone in the same condition as many of the other reviewers. Phone was folded without the screen protector and with finger marks.','2021-12-18 19:29:55',2,17,410),(296,'  Edit11/12/2020:I\'ve had to drop this thing to one star. Ever since owning this, the 5ghz wifi is bad. Android Auto loses connectivity constantly unless you use Motorola\'s solution - a 6\" cable. Yep 6 inches. While at first there seemed to be an interest in finding a solution through Motorola, our pleas have been basically abandoned. No issues like this on my Note 9. I am saddened as the phone is nice, but an old version of Android, failing Android auto, and terrible wifi plagues this for it\'s price.End EditI badly want to make this 5 stars but there\'s just a few things with it where it doesn\'t pull through. That being said, I actually would not have chosen a different phone if I could have.Pros:-The flip! It sounds stupid, but there\'s something about the screen and the flip of it. It decreases it\'s size wonderfully and it\'s nice having that form factor.-Build quality. This thing, the design is fantastic. Engineering is wonderful. There is no slop whatsoever and I love that. They cared about this device-5g support. Not much to say there.-Camera. Quad pixel is awesome. In the end the photo is 12mp, but it uses 48 to create that. Results are fantastic.-No bloat! This has a legitimately clean Google OS with no bloat, it\'s awesome.-Comes with usb-c to 3.5mm headphone jack.Cons:-Price tag. For a smaller battery, not top of the line hardware, it has a top of the line price.-Wifi card in it is definitely crappier than my note 9. Cellular is fine.-OS. It is released with Android 10 and still on it-No wireless charging. For a phone this pricey, wouldn\'t have taken much.Things to note:-The folding screen does leave some feelable creases in the screen. You can\'t really see it when the screen is on though. Might REALLY bother some people. Doesn\'t bother me at all.-They probably could have decreases the price by $100 by just shipping it in a normal box. That being said, it was a fun unboxing.','2021-12-18 19:29:55',4,5,410),(297,'  Update 8/21/2020: Noticed some black dots on the bottom left of the screen which remain no matter what is on the screen.  Sometimes a light green or pink blob can be seen behind them. Was this phone model rushed to market before it was quite ready?  Returning.Update 8/18/2020:  I\'ve now had the phone for 18 days and am becoming disappointed.  The size is longer than I like; top-heavy in a back pocket, very large for a purse,  and with wallet cases not available until Oct-Nov. I\'m about to put my phone chips back in my Moto 4.  I did get a flexible case in order to attach a strap through its hole for the jack, but there\'s nothing to protect the screen so can\'t carry in a pocket.  The rear cameras are too close to the phone\'s edge, making it difficult to get a landscape-mode photo without a finger showing at the top where it\'s holding the camera.  I\'m also having great difficulty getting the camera to actually take a photo when I press the button. Sometimes it does, sometimes it just puts a frame up on the screen or other such thing and doesn\'t take the photo.  It\'s also taking photos without the button being pressed (delayed photo? No timer is on that I know of) Came home yesterday with about as many photos of feet, thighs or table legs as intended shots.  At first I could zoom in or out, but it\'s in some setting now where I can\'t do that, and I can\'t figure out how to just get to a normal, auto format.  I\'m looking for a user\'s manual for the camera but haven\'t been able to find one.  When on the internet, sometimes a page will jump; just wiggle like crazy; and the only way to stop it is to back out of the page.  What I thought were good instructions in the Moto app aren\'t showing up for the camera.  This phone will be going back if I can\'t find satisfactory instructions for the camera.It\'s a pretty phone if you like the size, and the features are plentiful but possibly too complicated for me.  This is not your grandmother\'s phone.  (I\'m an early-adapter 69 year old.)Original review: I\'ve been reading reviews of phone cameras for months, and had been waiting for the Iphone 12 to come out in hopes of getting an Iphone 11pro at an affordable price.  Then this phone was announced. The Motorola Edge has all the camera features hoped for, AND much more storage than an Iphone.  What I couldn\'t figure out from the listing was whether the 256 Gb was internal storage or what could be added with a mini SD card.  It turned out to be both. There\'s 256 internal, AND a mini SD card can also be added!I\'ve had this a little short of two days.  The wrapped edge effect is very attractive, especially when using it to see how far charged it is, or for an enhancement for certain photos.  The wrapped edge can be turned off for specific apps so you don\'t have to read the news wrapped around the edges if you don\'t want. There\'s an action bar which is part of the screen on the right side of the phone that provides several navigation shortcuts.  It will take awhile to learn all the gestures to use this phone, but it has very easy instructions in the Moto app, so  I\'ll eventually learn to use the gestures and most of the phone\'s features.I especially like being able to open the camera with a couple of twists of the wrist, even before opening the phone with the onscreen fingerprint sensor.  I\'ve just taken a few photos so far.  They\'re very clear.  The portrait photo background blurs the background a little.  There are lots of photo enhancement tools to try, and the cameras were the main reason for purchasing this phone.  Unedited photos taken in the evening are posted.  The tilt of the camera changed the lighting considerably. The second photo was taken a moment after the first to level the railing.  It also changed the lighting color.  The third photo doesn\'t have any kind of filter.  It showed fuchsia on the screen, so what you see is what you get.  Lots to learn about the cameras, which will be fun.The phone\'s solar black color is  iridescent, giving a beautiful, subtle color glow to the back of the phone.  So far there isn\'t a case for the Motorola Edge (just for the Edge +) but that surely will be available soon. (Looking for a wallet case with a clear edge and a strap for attaching to a belt loop while in a back pocket.)The sound quality is excellent.This phone is more exciting than any phone I\'ve seen since my first smart phone; the Note 2; which was extremely difficult to learn to use.  It\'s a top-end phone at a mid-range price; especially if you can get it at the opening sale price.','2021-12-18 19:29:57',4,13,411),(298,'  Update: Had to return do to not being able to get Verizon LTE + or 5G. Also I couldnt receive Text messages.This phone is one of the best you can get at the price for a 5G phone. It is nearly identical to the Edge+ with a few differences. Its a big phone but slim enough to fit well in your hand. The edge display has minimal uses but it is good for some mobile games. I have some concern that if you drop it the edge display won\'t with stand a drop on a hard surface. Motorola will only update it to Android 11. Overall this is a solid phone for the price and specs.PROS* decent display* good battery life* 3.5 mm headphone jack* good call qualityCONS* in-display fingerprint sensor isn\'t the best* no wireless charging* camera is just okay* curved display limited','2021-12-18 19:29:57',3,10,411),(299,'  Very nice phone with a few caveats. First I am a consumer user not a business enterprise.The phone is fast, very nice screen, quality build with Android 10, no carrier bloatware. The big thing for me is the replaceable battery. Every new smartphone I have had to buy is because the built battery would not hold a charge and was a pain to replace. (I know I have done it myself).Now for some issues with setup.  There is no user manual available.  I went to the Samsung site and not there.  Therefore you have to stumble through by yourself.Inserting the SIM and SD Card.  The phone has SIM 1 and SIM 2.  for Verizon use SIM 1.  The SIM card is installed under the SD Card.  The slots are under the battery.  Turning the phone on is intuitive, push the button on the side.  Turning the phone off is not intuitive, the button does not work.  The off button is on the upper right corner next to the settings button, both visible after swiping down.  Transferring data and apps from your old phone is a snap, follow the prompts.Since this a Global phone when you turn it on it automatically selects the best carrier, GMS or CDMA.  What this means when you turn it on the first time it will connect but maybe not to Verizon.  Here is what you have to do.Go to:SettingsConnectionsMobile NetworkNetwork ModeManualNetwork OperatorsChoose VerizonNow you are all set and on the Verizon network. If you try to activate on line with the EMIE it tells you it is invalid however the phone is on the network and works fine.  I called Verizon and the only reason this happens is that the global phone is not yet in their EMIE database yet it will work fine (Verizon sells the same phone with a slightly different sub-model number).  The only thing you will notice is that on line under \"My Devices\"  you will see your phone number but no picture or model of your phone.Some have questioned say that the phone does not support WIFI calling, it does in fact support WIFI calling, to activate you have to enter emergency contact information.  I know this correct because I have it set up for WI-FI calling.  Just ordered an OTTERBOX from their website, 20% less than on Amazon with free shipping.Hope this helpful, great phone','2021-12-18 19:29:57',5,3,411),(300,'  I bought this phone for many of the reasons B. Rodgers cited in his thorough review. The phone is bigger and much heavier than what I expected [ UPDATE: but I got used to the bigger size and weight].Flagship phones are designed for obsolescence and cost twice as much. They have sealed-in batteries that typically fail after 2 years, and usually only promise 1-2 years of security updates. Since the Xcover Pro has Android 10 from the factory, it reportedly can support more thorough or lasting updates than Android 9 phones. The Xcover Pro guarantees 3-4 years of security updates, and has a 24-month warranty, whereas most phones offer only 12 month warranties and maybe 1 OS update.The battery can be swapped out before a new work shift, and swapped out at the end of its useful life, using only our bare hands. This phone is rugged, water resistant, and has good cameras; other phones with removable batteries have no water-resistance, low-end processors, and low-end cameras. I don\'t want to contribute to electronic waste, so I chose a phone that is designed to last. The ultra-wide-angle camera seems to cover about 135 degrees, so you can stand in a room corner and fit the whole room into the frame.It has a left-side button that can be assigned to any two apps via a long press or short press, and a top button that can be assigned to launch any two apps. The right-side power button can also be assigned, and I don\'t have to lift the phone off the desk to use the fingerprint reader that is built into the right-side power button.* Dictation without the cloudThis phone can convert speech to text internally, without sending your voice to the cloud. I confirmed this by dictating text into apps while holding the right-side button, even when I had the phone in airplane mode.* Wi-Fi callingI need Wi-Fi calling so I can place and receive calls without paying exorbitant roaming fees when I travel, while using my regular phone number. Although Samsung reassured me that all their phones including this one support WI-Fi calling, after purchase Samsung support told me that Wi-Fi calling requires cell-carrier bloatware baked into the phone\'s firmware. Consequently, if you want this phone to have Wi-Fi calling, the only option is to get a carrier version. In the US it is only Verizon, so you will have to put up with the worst customer service I have experienced in years, or purchase the phone from Verizon then use it on another network.* Point Of Sale (POS) transactions:Samsung claims that this is the only phone with EMV Level-1 compatibility: \"You can now accept payments without the need for additional hardware. The Galaxy XCover Pro has EMV Level-1 that makes it mPOS-ready.\" However, the Xcover Pro does NOT have MST (Magnetic Secure Transfer) hardware, and therefore does not support Samsung Pay for paying at point of sale (POS) locations.Samsung claims I can use Google Pay, but I have not tried that, as I do not want Google to log every transaction I make with my phone. Unlike other payment systems, Samsung Pay uses MST hardware on their most popular phones to make credit card transactions compatible with all POS magnetic strip readers.The phone does have NFC payment, which works only on POS systems that support NFC. So Ironically, the XCover Pro has more capabilities for accepting payments from other credit cards, but fewer capabilities for making payments with your own credit card due to lack of MST hardware.This unlocked Xcover Pro has powered down for no apparent reason, and self-reset numerous times. I don\'t know if that\'s due to any of my installed apps, though they were working fine on my older & slower Samsung phone. I\'m returning this phone and trying my luck with the Verizon version because Wi-Fi calling is essential to me. The Verizon XCover Pro is not self-resetting, but I have not yet allowed it to install the latest OS update, so I don\'t know if that will cause the resets.*** UPDATE on 2020-07-25: ***I purchased the $500 Verizon XCover Pro with a $200 discount to be credited monthly over 24 months, and an additional $200 credit on my first Verizon bill for porting my phone number to a Verizon Enterprise account. Obtaining a new account from Verizon was so aggravating I\'m not sure it will be worth the savings.1) As far as I know my Verizon XCover Pro has not self-reset. I\'ve had it for almost two months. I suppose I should restart the phone.2) If anyone has conclusively been able to get this unlocked XCover Pro to work with Wi-Fi calling, please reply to this review and let us know. Samsung told me Wi-Fi calling is not possible on an unlocked phone.3) If you have been able to get this phone at a discount from Verizon on a personal account, let us know.4)  Unsurprisingly, Verizon\'s custom bloatware on the Verizon version of the XCover Pro disabled the built-in FM radio. Carriers do this to push us into their data plan. So no emergency radio reception for when the towers are down or out of reach, and no radio feed without a data plan on the Verizon version.5) The FM radio on this unlocked phone was not disabled. However, I could not get FM radio reception using  the NextRadio app (all I heard was noise) even though reception was great on my nearby Android tablet using the same wired earphones as an antenna. Does the FM radio work on your XCover Pro? You you can install the NextRadio app and use wired earphones as an antenna.','2021-12-18 19:29:57',1,15,411),(301,'  I like this phone a lot.  I got this to replace a Samsung Galaxy S6 Active.  That six year old phone was the most trouble-free phone I\'ve ever owned going all the way back to the mid-1990s.  I\'ve been hard on it, but it still looks like a brand new phone.  I was reluctant to give it up, but the battery was giving out, the phone was spending a lot of time tethered to the charger, and the case is sealed so it\'s not easy to change the battery.  I decided to go with a new phone instead.The Xcover PRO is actually a lot larger and heavier than I was expecting, but I\'m getting used to it.  I unboxed the phone, put the battery in it and charged it up.  It took about 90 minutes for a full charge.  Transferring my old apps and contacts to the new phone was painless and was over in mere minutes.  I plugged in the SIM card and made a few calls on it.  It works fine on AT&T.  Battery life appears to be excellent.  I still have more than 50% at the end of the day, so I could probably get through a second day at work without having to recharge.  The camera gets some great shots.  I love the combo side key/fingerprint reader.  It\'s the perfect place to put it... right on the unlock button.Nothing too mysterious about this phone.  It took me a little while to puzzle out where the SD card plugs in.  Get a magnifying glass and look for the legend stamped in the case next to the SIM slot.The only minor gripe is that some of the stuff that this page says comes with the phone wasn\'t in the box I got.  It was all just minor stuff, so it didn\'t prevent me from using the phone, but I\'ll include it here so that the seller can correct their information on this page (or if it is correct, maybe they could just send the stuff to me).

My whole family is on a T-Mobile plan. T-Mobile is also one of the most accessible providers in the US when it comes to BYOD (bring your own device) phones, and every \"unlocked\" phone I\'ve ever had worked with their network, except this one. Data works fine over the 4G network but it\'s when you go to make a call that things get crappy. As soon as you dial out or the phone starts to ring for an incoming call, it switches over to 3G and you get all the quality of a 20 year old technology. T-Mobile was super helpful and bumped me to higher tier tech support immediately, but soon tracked the problem down to this model not being compliant with their VoLTE system, which is because Samsung didn\'t make the phone compatible with the T-Mobile network. No option of getting a network update exists from T-Mobile, because they\'re not the ones writing that code, Samsung is.Samsung\'s tech support was an embarrassing testimony to a behemoth in the cell phone world. Their business tech agent (this phone is part of their business line of devices) had almost no information in her system about this issue. In fact, the IMEI number showed up as being locked to Verizon while the phone\'s own  model number, software, and box all indicated it was an unlocked version. All the poor lady could do was recommend I go back to T-Mobile and ask them to make it work. T-Mobile also has a page where you can check to see if your device is compatible with BYOD, and entering the IMEI on that page immediately returns the message that the Xcover Pro is NOT compatible. All-in-all, the experience left me with a nasty taste for Samsung in my mouth. I sold my old phone the day before the new one arrived, but because of the incompatibility I ended up without a phone for three days, which in this day and age is horrible when you run a business and need to make and take calls, navigate to customers, and deal with emails on the run. The phone seemed great, but the experience was awful.The moral of the story is that Samsung is presenting this phone both here on Amazon as well as on their own website as an unlocked phone, which it is not - at least in the generally accepted meaning of that word. It may be unlocked from Verizon, but it\'s not compatible with a lot of other carriers. A customer shouldn\'t have to actually buy the phone to test it out or check it for compatibility (you need an IMEI number in most cases to do this). This information should be clearly presented by Samsung, and it\'s their failure that it\'s not. Shame on them!Edit to add: A lot of other reviews here mention problems with Wi-Fi calling, but I wonder whether some of the posters are confusing that with VoLTE which is like Wi-Fi calling but over the provider\'s data network. I personally did not have issues with Wi-Fi calling. It connected to my home network just fine and when connected, it used that connection for inbound and outbound calls (the LTE signal bars disappear when you\'re on a Wi-Fi network). It\'s the VoLTE part of the equation that\'s the issue with this phone on some carriers. It simply isn\'t capable of using many of the data networks for voice calls, which almost any other modern phone can do.','2021-12-18 19:29:57',5,10,411),(303,'  TL;DR: If you want an S-Pen, iPhone, or a phone to play PUBG on this is not your phone. Everyone else should seriously consider it.If anyone asks you what phone they should buy, this should be #1 on the list. It\'s not for everyone - but it is for everyone that doesn\'t know enough about phones to know why they need the latest Galaxy S, Note, Asus ROG, or other specialty or flagship phones.This phone is rugged, yes. but it looks almost identical to most every black rectangle out there. Nobody is going to look at this phone and think it\'s for construction workers. It\'s got a little extra on the corners, and a slight lip around the screen to keep the screen safer. It doesn\'t affect usability in any way.Why else should this phone be at the top of lists? There\'s so many good reasons:* Durability. Yeah, no phone is invincible, but being able to survive getting knocked off a table onto a tile floor is great (and the reason I had to replace my wife\'s phone).* Headphone jack. Yep, their loss isn\'t mourned or protested anymore, but it\'s nice to have.* Waterproof. Every phone should be.* User replaceable battery. This phone proves that there is no valid argument about phone thickness, bulkiness, or loss of waterproofing by offering this. It takes 5 seconds to swap a battery.* Expandable memory slot. Still on most phones, but this phone does it without giving up a second SIM card slot.* Dual sim. A lot of phones give up the memory card slot to have this feature. Not this phone. Put two lines in it, and a memory card.* USB-C. It doesn\'t have the blazing fast charging rates that the Note 10 has, but it\'s still fast.* Fingerprint reader in the power button. In-screen readers are still terrible (nearly unusable at times in my Note 10), this one is fast and accurate.* Modern Processor. The Exynos 9611 isn\'t their flagship processor, but it\'s a huge step up from what is put in most of the rugged phones out there. It\'s about equivalent to a 2018 flagship chip (Snapdragon 665) in terms of speed. Plenty fast for anything that isn\'t \"hardcore\" phone gaming.* IPS screen. Not a flagship OLED screen, but it looks fantastic, and better than standard LCD.* Gorilla Glass 5. Scratch resistant and tough.* Notification LED. I miss this on newer phones, but it has an LED so you can see if there\'s active notifications.* Regular and wide angle lenses.* Half the price of a Galaxy S20.Nitpicks (or the only stuff I miss from a flagship device).Tap to wake is not enabled by default.The holepunch camera hole is bigger than flagship phones.Single speaker instead of stereo.It might be larger than some people want.No Samsung Pay means you can\'t use it with old magnetic-only card readers.No 5G. This is a stretch, since few phones do have it.','2021-12-18 19:29:57',1,13,411),(304,'  Edit: I was able to find batteries for this phone from a retailer in the Netherlands which now makes this phone a 5.----The removable battery is what made me spring for this phone.  It\'s the feature I care about most.  I bet that if you\'ve stumbled upon this review you also care a great deal for this feature and don\'t want to get suckered in to buying a phone that needs to be replaced every 2 years.I have no complaints about the phone at all - it provides the perfect blend of functionality, performance and practicality the market has to offer at the moment.Despite this, the killer feature of this phone cannot be experienced if its removable batteries are not made available and at a reasonable price if/when they are.  The battery (GH43-04993A) appears to be available outside the US.

I started off with the Galaxy S3 moving to Galaxy S6, the Galaxy S8 Active ( my favorite so far) to the Galaxy Xcover Pro. I had to replace my S8 Active with a Xcover pro, because the S8 phone would not charge anymore in any way, and the Xcover pro was the closest match, even though it doesn\'t come close to the Galaxy S8 Active. Don\'t even know why Samsung has discontinued it.I purchased my Galaxy pro around a month ago on Amazon, which provided a 30 day return policy, however around 3 weeks ago, I started experiencing problems with my phone screen, the phone started restarting on its own, and I started seeing some white lines on my screen. Did not give it too much attention as I was very busy at work, and did not have any time to attend this issue.A couple days ago, the screen colors started fading, and the screen started acting up even more, tried calling samsung customer service yesterday but the hold times were over 2 hours, ended up giving up. This morning, I woke up to find the screen almost 90% faded, and the touch keys were not working, I was unable to use the phone at this point.I decided to take the phone to the nearest samsung electronics service center in Maywood NJ. The manager over there was very friendly, accepted to service the phone even though I had no appointment. Once I showed her the model, she told me that she wasnt sure if this model was serviced at this location, but still showed it to the Tech which then confirmed that there are no spare part available for this phone. I was then given the option to ship the phone to samsung and get it fixed under warranty, which would leave me without a phone for 7 business days!!! and that was my only option since I have no other phone to use ( Galaxy S8 wont charge). I refused and was then advised to call 1-800-SAMSUNGThis is when it gets even better, the service rep who picked up the phone was making it look like I was making this story up, and was trying to convince me that there was never a screen issue with this phone, and that this is the first time he hears this, I then asked to speak with a supervisor, which told me the same thing and was then transferred to case management. After two hours on the phone and 1 hour driving to get in and back from the service center, case management advised me to call \"U break it we fix it\" which is the Authorised repair facility for Samsung as mentioned by case management. I call their location in Westwood, and guess what?? They do not have any spare parts and I was then referred to the Service Center in Maywood that handles uncommon phones like mine. SO guess what, 3 hours later back to square one, I took a day off to resolve this issue.Bottom line is Samsung customer service is the worst!!! Will be duping this piece of trash in the garbage, and will purchase another phone with any other manufacturer that has an android platform.Thank you SAMSUNG','2021-12-18 19:29:57',5,19,411),(307,'  How I hate this phone let me count the ways:1. Phone is roughly the same speed as my S7 on latest update. A definite sacrifice.2. Phone doesn\'t support wireless charging.3. No always on display; closest I could get is a clock screen saver while on charger.4. And the doozy: phone is supposed to be \'waterproof\', only problem is the USB port insists that phone is wet even when it couldn\'t possibly be, like after charging to 100% over night and waking up to see the phone says it\'s wet.  Now once it says it\'s wet you\'re done because it won\'t charge and takes typically 8 hours to \'dry\'.  If you\'re on a mission or just on the road with maps, you\'re screwed.  Flush cache, restart, fan, vacuum cleaner, rice... Doesn\'t matter.  Yes, the phone allows you to replace the battery but who wants to do minor surgery every three hours and carry an external charger just because of a bug.Apart from #3, which in my opinion makes the phone useless for mission critical \'activities\' it works ok for someone, just not for anything I need a phone for.','2021-12-18 19:29:59',5,20,412),(308,'  Have had this phone for a about a month now. Works great and takes perfectly fine photos, BTW (better than what I had from Samsung four years ago). It\'s truly rugged, and has a snappy response to the apps and functions. The mono-speaker is just fine as a speakerphone, too, almost too loud for my 70-year-old ears. Battery requires just one charge in the early morning and keeps going all day (YouTube vids, music, exercise app, timer, weather, solitaire/checkers/chess... and all the other power-hungry apps I use), especially with the Android 10 features helping to monitor and manage power usage. Will order a replacement battery when they are available in the U.S., which means I can keep my phone running in tip-top shape for years! Thank, you Samsung for bringing back the replaceable battery, on this phone at least! Is it the ultimate smartphone in 2020? No. But it hits the sweet spot for me: all the functions I need, a great price, and a phone that will not die when the first battery gives out.','2021-12-18 19:29:59',5,2,412),(309,'  I\'ve been using this case since day 1 of getting my S21 Ultra and has been a great phone case everyday since. I recently got cutoff by a truck while riding my motorcycle whilr traveling about 45-50mph and wrecked pretty hard. My phone was attached to my motorcycle when it happened but was found 20-30 feet away from where the motorcycle came to a stop. The whole front end of my motorcycle was in pieces, all over the road like it had exploded, but surprisingly my phone had only a couple very small scratches on the bottom corner where the case had been slightly knocked off. Other than that my phone is in perfect condition, no cracks in the screen or dents anywhere on the phone. This is the only brand of case I will ever put my phone in after this and highly recommend anyone looking for a tough yet sleek phone case to get this case without hesitation. See pics of damage to the case.','2021-12-18 19:29:59',2,10,412),(310,'  I\'ve owned a tech 21 case in the past and didn\'t like the feel. This is a different ballgame. This case feels comfortable in the hand. The case sticks up from the face of the phone providing protection if you decide to lie the phone face down. It does the same for the camera on the back. It provides a good grip for the phone, not slippery. The back is supposed to be kind of see through but it\'s really not so if you\'re looking for a clear case this isn\'t it. The buttons are great and they supply extra buttons green and blue buttons if you want to switch them out. Cut outs are exactly where they should be. The case is also thin. Doesn\'t add much bulk at all. Tech 21 says this case will protect your phone from a 12 foot drop. If it works even close to that then that\'s pretty exceptional. Oh and it doesn\'t interfere with a screen saver. The back gets a little smudgy but I\'ve seen a lot worse.','2021-12-18 19:29:59',5,11,412),(311,'  I have always ordered tech 21 cases because I love them this year they changed it up for my s21 ultra the edges are no longer grippy they\'re smooth and slippery which makes it harder to hold. Not sure why they changed it up why change something that works very unhappy about how slippery it is now. I have always bought them because of how grippy they are.','2021-12-18 19:29:59',5,13,412),(312,'  Just amazing!

It lasted me and worked well for over 4 years.  I just got the Galaxy S21 5G (not the plus or Ultra) and bought the Tech21 case for that.  The case fits the phone very nicely. It snaps in and fits snuggly with no gaps in the seams. The case has a raised rim around the front so that the phone is not resting on the glass when placed face down (on a flat surface) as well as a raised rim around the cameras and flash when resting on its back.  The case is smooth yet has a good grip feel to it.  The material is firm but flexible and feels much more comfortable to hold than the phone itself without the case.Overall, a great case.','2021-12-18 19:29:59',4,17,412),(314,'  This case is unusable because the buttons are so bad on the side. I\'ve swapped colors, reseated them, done everything that can be done and theyve never felt good. Power button is atrocious. Volume Rockers are okayish.

It has an advanced technology, operating system, function, and the fingerprint reader works better than any phone I\'ve had. Having said that, it\'s very easy to setup. I have AT&T as my carrier, I just swaped the sim card from my old phone and it was ready to setup. Keep in mind this phone does have a Setup Wizard which guides you throught the process. It does have a slot for expandable memory. The technology of this phone works great, I have a pair of Raycon E55 earbuds that have the new 5.0 bluetooth technology (stereo sound) and they sounded awesome on my previous phone but they sound even better on this new N200 5G. I was conflicted between buying the N200 5G and N10 5G, both are very similar but personally I think the N200 5G is the better model. Do yourself a favor and spend an extra few dollars to buy the suggested phone protection case with a black surround. This phone is worth protecting the cameras on the back, against shock if dropped, and it will keep the phone from sliding around as it is very lightweight (but very good quality) and has a slick surface.

However, a few things put me off to it. I didnt like the feel of it in my hand, can\'t explain. It\'s like it didn\'t fit my hand as well as my LG. Anyway, great phone. Great picture and camera quality. Great user friendly. Had latest hardware and future updates to come so no problem there. Didn\'t care for the side fingerprint reader but that\'s my personal opinion and for some reason with the way screenshots are set up with this phone I kept accidentally taking screenshots by merely holding it. The only problem that really stood between me and this phone was ultimately the problem with the network I preferred. I\'m verizon all day baby and this phone did not want to accommodate that, no matter how many calls I made to straight talk and things they did on their end to make it work. God bless em they really tried but they never could get all the features to work as should and that\'s when I ultimately knew I couldnt keep it. But don\'t let my experience deter you from a good phone. If u must be Verizon like me, u may have an issue or 2, but if att is not a problem for u, then I say go for it.

I\'ve owned a number of iPhones and Android devices in the past, from $800+ devices down to $200 phones like this one. I cannot recall when was the last time I had such a terrible phone. After a month of use, I\'m throwing it in the trash to buy another. Money wasted.To summarize its specs and how they actually are:- The screen is advertised as a big thing, but forget about it! You\'re never gonna get 90 Hz because the processor cannot keep up. Scrolling through messages or Instagram feed you see lag, so what\'s the point of a 90Hz capable screen if it lags and you see it at 30 Hz? Color accuracy is good though- The phone\'s performance is the worst I\'ve seen in the past decade! Forget about multitasking, with no open background apps, when I go to the supermarket I cannot switch between the shopping list app and the coupons app, because every time I switch the apps reload from the beginning. Screen lags, apps take forever to open, and I\'m not even talking about games. Never had such a slow and frustrating experience texting, as the phone can\'t keep up with my typing on the keyboard nor scrolling through threads.- The camera is absolute potato. Remember to grab another camera with you because this is the absolute worst. For fun I compared the camera with that of my previous phones, and found it to be mostly similar in various lightning conditions to that of my Sony Ericsson C901, released in 2009!!!- The battery is huge and great, I can get a full day of power out of the phone with no issue. If the phone wasn\'t so slow and I did not have to wait for a minute for snapchat to open or type messages over and over again until the keyboard keeps up, my screen time would be inferior and I bet the battery would last even longer.- The fingerprint reader is slow and makes mistakes more times that it unlocks the phone. Face scan is also pretty much useless, as it depends on the camera which is potato. The last time I had a phone without a biometric unlock was 2014. Today, I am dragged 7 years back in time to once again use passwords to unlock my phone. It\'s extremely frustratingSTAY AWAY! Buy Xiaomi','2021-12-18 19:30:07',3,13,417),(335,'  This phone is not unlocked. It is T-Mobile Only.

The camel leather with the phantom silver phone gives it the vibes of a vintage camera crossed with a vintage hardcover. It keeps the phone slim, for better or for worse - i.e., it\'s as friendly in the pocket as this phone is gonna get, but it doesn\'t solve the issue of the bumped-out camera lenses preventing the phone from laying flat on the table. Nor does it do much to address the risk of a tiny grain of sand or salt scratching the lens when so lain - the depth between the case surface and the lens surface seems measurable only in microns. I\'ll keep it until I see a nice case that lays fully flat without the left side of the phone jittering up and down when you tap it.','2021-12-18 19:30:09',1,6,418),(341,'  It says leather bur seems plastic.

It does not rock back and forth. Leather is decent for the price and seems to initially be textured and grippy. It has started to darken from the oils of my palms already. Though note this case is very sensitive to scratches. Overall nice pairing with a silver phone in this camel color.***After one week***As other reviews have mentioned the front is made of plastic. This leaves me scratching my head as to how Samsung could have taken case through R&D and been happy with it. Needless to say I now have a two tone case... Which I will be returning shortly.

It has less memory and no SD expansion compared to the regular S20 and it is a specific to Verizon due to their 5G band specifications.

The snapdragon 865 in this thing means it\'s got a beastly gpu/cpu for any heavy duty tasks you can think of. Gaming on it means you can run everything at max setting at a buttery smooth fps. I haven\'t really gamed on mobile before, but I\'m really having fun with what\'s out there. The screen is great and has the 120 fps option that few phones have. The only problem with 120 fps is that developers need to update their software to support it, meaning a lot of games/apps will still run locked at 60 fps, but that\'s not the phones fault. It\'s kind of funny that the S series now has bigger screens than the older note series phones, I still remember when the older notes were considered \"massive\" at 5.5 inches and now here with are with the smallest mainstream S phone at 6.2 inches. The camera is top notch and way better than the note 5 that I\'m replacing, which wasn\'t a slouch in the camera department itself.Being a renewed phone, I didn\'t notice any major issues, looks as good as new at a great price.

He has a Galaxy A10e and I was going to perches the A12 but it seemed to be exactly the same but just a different style (I returned it). The A32 has a better camera than the A12 and A10e and typing and navigating the phone is way smoother (like an iPhone). It appears to be glass and I really like the look and feel of the phone. I have not used it but once to look at it, so I hope nothing goes wrong. I will be buying a second one for my daughter as well because she loves to take pictures.

I\'m careful about how i lay it and dont leave it under the covers or pillow anymore.  I topped it off with a nice glass screen cover.  Its got a samsung screen, so the appearance is gorgeous.

So this A32 4G is a really decent phone, and the international version has more memory, more \"hard drive\" space, less junkware, and is slightly more compact than the domestic version, but check first to see if your preferred domestic carrier will connect to it.','2021-12-18 19:30:14',5,15,422),(372,'  Nice work ?','2021-12-18 19:30:15',4,5,423),(373,'  I\'ve been using this case since day 1 of getting my S21 Ultra and has been a great phone case everyday since.

The whole front end of my motorcycle was in pieces, all over the road like it had exploded, but surprisingly my phone had only a couple very small scratches on the bottom corner where the case had been slightly knocked off. Other than that my phone is in perfect condition, no cracks in the screen or dents anywhere on the phone.

This case feels comfortable in the hand. The case sticks up from the face of the phone providing protection if you decide to lie the phone face down. It does the same for the camera on the back. It provides a good grip for the phone, not slippery. The back is supposed to be kind of see through but it\'s really not so if you\'re looking for a clear case this isn\'t it. The buttons are great and they supply extra buttons green and blue buttons if you want to switch them out. Cut outs are exactly where they should be. The case is also thin. Doesn\'t add much bulk at all. Tech 21 says this case will protect your phone from a 12 foot drop. If it works even close to that then that\'s pretty exceptional. Oh and it doesn\'t interfere with a screen saver. The back gets a little smudgy but I\'ve seen a lot worse.','2021-12-18 19:30:15',4,18,423),(375,'  I have always ordered tech 21 cases because I love them this year they changed it up for my s21 ultra the edges are no longer grippy they\'re smooth and slippery which makes it harder to hold.

It lasted me and worked well for over 4 years.  I just got the Galaxy S21 5G (not the plus or Ultra) and bought the Tech21 case for that.  The case fits the phone very nicely. It snaps in and fits snuggly with no gaps in the seams. The case has a raised rim around the front so that the phone is not resting on the glass when placed face down (on a flat surface) as well as a raised rim around the cameras and flash when resting on its back.  The case is smooth yet has a good grip feel to it.

The case provides 10 ft of tested drop protection and has an elevated bump to protect the three lens camera.  I had originally bought the Tech21 Evo Check case as I preferred a black case.  However, the Evo Check case\'s matte finish on the sides was too slippery and thus, too risky for this expensive phone.  This Evo Clear case provides satisfactory grip and is comfortable in your hand.  Other reviewers have noted that this case is difficult to put on or remove from your phone.  I recommend that you insert the phone length wise (camera side first) into the case.  By doing so, the phone is easily inserted into the case.

I\'ve owned iPhones since the original came out more than a decade ago. I\'m also a developer and I loathed most of their developer policies, so I consider myself someone who appreciates good design and usability as opposed to your run of the mill fan boy. This whole review is from the perspective of someone making a switch.Hardware: The phone itself, while feeling substantial, is actually quite pleasant to hold and use. I had a popsocket wallet and case on my iPhone 11 which made it feel no lighter than this phone, sans case but with pop-wallet.  The phone is super fast, just as fast if not snappier than my iPhone 11. It has 12gb of memory, and from what I can tell, and it gets used. This is probably an artifact of running each process sandboxed but with iOS you literally have no visibility unless you apply a developer profile to the phone.Cameras: The cameras seem good, but honestly I think I prefer the iPhone better. For now. I don\'t really understand the different modes of the camera and I also don\'t understand why pictures look so much better after they are taken than when they are on the view finder. iPhone wins here, hands down. That being said: the iPhone seems like a great vacation phone. Simple and geared towards consumption and entertainment, with a great camera to boot. From the pictures I\'ve taken, I can tell this thing can produce great snaps however it certainly isn\'t as simple as on the iPhone. So while this will be a great \"urban life\" phone and hopefully will take those impromptu photos that occasionally pop up - the only ones I ever really share or look at again are ones from vacations, and I don\'t plan on using this phone on vacation.Battery: The battery seems to last a good amount of time, I definitely got a good 12-14 hour day under my belt with your typical \"this is a new toy\" usage. That seems more than acceptable, I just hope it lasts.The outer screen is very usable! Typing on it, even with my adult sized hands felt about the same as using an old iPhone, and while not quite as spread out as your normal phone, it\'s also much easier to operate one handed. Instead of going on and on about it, i\'ll just say this: I can pretty much do everything I need to do  on the outer screen alone - and while I thought I would miss the wider aspect ratio, it turns out pretty much everything we already do with our phones is set up to flow vertically; not horizontally.The inner screen literally made me chuckle a little and smile when I turned it on. It is amazing. Turn the \"tablet\" experience on in the settings to experience another smile and chuckle. It can get so ridiculously bright that it\'s probably a health hazard, and both displays offer the night mode familiar to iPhone users (you need to turn up the intensity to match the default Apple experience). It does have a plastic screen protector on it, which I understand you can have removed, but it doesn\'t feel fragile. The plastic protector does offer that \"sticky\" feeling every now (depending on the condition of your finger) and then, its best you keep it clean to prevent that.The folding mechanism: it is solid, it takes effort to close it and while I delicately and slowly fold it, there is absolutely no need. The mechanism feels deliberate and premium. It\'s also pretty silent, although I do hear a little static noise when I unfold it. I also thought I heard creaking noises, but it turns out that\'s the noise Android makes when you lock it.Flex mode: This is also great, also made me smile. One note, when you use this phone in Flex mode with the camera in the air (which is how you would need to use it to do a video conference), it is not properly weighted and often tips over on its own. I solved this with my pop socket/wallet, but I would have expected this phone to be balanced correctly, given that the Flex nature is marketed so prominently.Software & UX: Honestly, android is great. I downloaded all the same apps I had on iPhone (literally everything looks the same) plus some ones that Apple won\'t list on their marketplace. I do have to buy all my games again, which isn\'t ideal, but now I\'m covered on both eco systems.Androids method of organizing apps and the home screen independently is much more coherent than iOS (you can still switch to the iOS method if you wish) and adding Widgets is much more useful on Android than the newly introduced functionality on iOS 14.What isn\'t great about the UX:- There\'s literally no help for switching from iPhone. After reading the online user manual, I gathered there\'s a helper Samsung app to transfer content, but I haven\'t yet used this.- Both samsung and google apps: I get that Samsung wants to offer its own apps, and I honestly am not a huge fan of Google and their eco system, but why have both? Surely Google\'s offerings can be downloaded on request, and Samsung wouldn\'t include their own version if it wasn\'t fully baked - so why have two. It is so confusing and honestly I still haven\'t quite determined if both of them are sync\'ing my photos or contacts or what. This is where the Apple mentality really (only) shines - by tightly controlling the Applications on a users phone, they can offer a consistent and unified experience. Samsung\'s apps, except for Internet, work well enough as far as I can tell so why not just go with those? Having Google Photos and Samsung Photos is pointless, having Samsung Pass store my passwords and then also Google asking to store it? Really? Any non developer Apple user could easily suspect this is a scam.Purchase experience: this is where it all fell apart for me. The phone arrived late, despite pre-ordering the literal minute it was listed. People who pre-ordered from Samsung were treated to $150-$250 off the price of the phone depending on your effort, as well as Galaxy Live buds for free due to the delay. Thankfully, Amazon also made me smile, but...Samsung really needs to re-examine the strategy with this phone. People who buy a $500 iPhone can walk into an Apple store and get expert advice right then and there. I purchased this $2000 phone and had to figure everything out myself. When I needed support on how to get the Galaxy Z Premier benefits, not even Samsung support knew what I was talking about. Together we figured it out but this is not acceptable.The box includes a charger, a ~3-5ft cable, 3 pieces of paper roughly the same size as a napkin, and the phone. Plus three separate warnings about using the phone.  This is also unacceptable. It would have been great to include a case, or at least headphones.Bonus: Your Phone + Windows 10. This is like iMessage and iPhoto integration on Apple products, but just infinitely better. You can make and receive calls through the PC, send and receive text messages and notifications, and DO FULL REMOTE DESKTOP TO YOUR PHONE. What a time to be alive... It works remarkably well and even follows all my different Windows devices (desktop, surface book, tablet).Other observations:1. Super fast charging must be different than normal USB PD charging. None of my PD chargers can super charge this, other than the one that came with it.2. There are currently no cases available on the market for this phone3. Yes, it is pretty heavy - but so is your average accessory laden iPhone4. It is slippery! Pop socket or finger ring recommendedFinal thought: Android gives me hope for a more useful phone. Or should I say pocket computer. iOS users must not be developers, or they\'re lying to themselves when they claim to replace a PC with an iPad. I can program on this Android device. I can use a keyboard and mouse and USB-C hub with this android device. I can load programs that would definitely not meet Apple\'s criteria for listing simply because they offer competing functionality or expose too much of the OS core. This is a true PC replacement. Especially when you throw Microsoft\'s RDP on there or a Citrix client.I\'ll update this review in 2 weeks but these are my initial thoughts.Update: the camera seems decent but I\'m still not convinced it\'s better than my iPhone. I added some pictures I took from the roof.','2021-12-18 19:30:26',1,16,429),(408,'  This is insane. I bought it on a whim at best buy and I\'m not kidding when I say it feels like its from the future. I\'ve been a phone geek forever and it takes something special to truly blow me away and this has done just that. My only concern is that I\'ll break it. I know it\'s gotten stronger with this next generation but its 2000 bucks. It\'s honestly probably worth that too. I don\'t say that lightly.If you can pick up one and you don\'t mind a ding on your credit card I think it\'s worth at least trying. You can completely customize the outer screen and I need screen with different wallpapers, widgets and apps so it\'s essentially 2 phones in one. Seriously this is a magical device. Kudos samsung for daring to innovate and taking a chance. I feel like we\'ll be seeing more of this design factor for a long time.','2021-12-18 19:30:26',3,14,429),(409,'  Talk about the ultimate device for portability.  Use it as a regular phone, open it up and it\'s a tablet, computer, Xbox and everything folds up nice and neat and can fit in your pockets.As you can see, I opted for accessories to maximize the full potential for this phone. And truthfully I think everyone should do so bc it\'s basically what this thing is built for. It\'s to put the endless phone, media, gaming possibilities in the palm of your hands. Granted, I spent another few $100 for a real carbon fiber case, removable lock stand, folding Bluetooth keyboard, screen protectors, aluminum camera protector, game controller, etc. But if you can afford this phone, it\'s worth the extras, if you don\'t already have them to get the full experience.This is my first folding phone and I\'m glad it was because this phone is a masterpiece, just shy of absolute perfection. The cons being a delicate folding screen, no S pen, no hidden embedded camera in screen, etc. But really? None of those things seriously diminish the value and absolute powerhouse of device this thing is.It WILL eat up everything you throw at it and ask for more. It\'s fast. Smooth. Nearly anything and everything you can think to customize more towards your liking, it will do it and even suggest things you wouldn\'t have necessarily thought of. Considering everything it does you\'d think it would just DEMOLISH the battery. Yes and No. You can max everything out and just go ham and still get a good 6hrs or so. More conservative use and settings, you could get up to nearly 2 days on one charge. It all just depends on how you use it.One more thing, bc I could go on forever, is be prepared for the attention you will receive. Which I ran some numbers and if I\'m right, only .006% of the entire world\'s population owns this phone. Therefore it is relatively rare. So surprisingly, despite the fact that this phone was released over 6 months ago, a lot of people have never seen one in person. And I have not come across one person yet that was not just blown away just from the whole folding action, let alone everything it actually does. Just to kind of prove a point a bit, when I had to go activate this phone, neither the manager or associate had seen the phone first hand yet. Granted Metro PCS doesn\'t sell it, but I would\'ve figured being owned by Tmobile, and in a major city that I hadn\'t been the only one to come in with this phone. So those with MetroPCS, yes it works. 5G and all. It will NOT work right out of the box with your old Sim. You have to go get it activated.I lied. Last thing. I dropped my phone already and it survived so it\'s not as fragile as we might think it is. But that is why I strongly suggest getting the carbon fiber case. Super thin but strong. Not a scratch, crack, nothing. Like it never happened.
