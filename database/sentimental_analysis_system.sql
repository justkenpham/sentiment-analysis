I can honestly say I normally can where these shoes until the soles have worn out. The shoelaces usually break about 5 months into it, but you can buy those anywhere and I just replace both when one breaks.

They are not just now starting to fall apart - they are reaching the point of complete failure. Both shoes have the glued on soles coming off with the left one almost half way off! Cheap glued on soles like most others now days - but it is obviously an inferior glue being used - not that any of the glue-on\'s seem that great.

It was a Winter day when I happened to walk through a slushy wet puddle from my driveway to my house. Within just a few minutes of the soles getting wet, the soles began flapping around as I walked! I\'ve already had these shoes beyond 90 days and so I was not able to return them for a full refund. The manufacturer must use a very poor quality rubber cement to stick the soles on. I even attempted to glue the soles back on with a number of different types of glue, and NOTHING worked. The soles continued to separate after a short time period.

It\'s nice to be able to use your phone fold it and then put it in your purse without worrying about the screen getting scratched. The memory and battery life are awful.

I decided to purchase the Samsung A52 5G Phone. I purchased it a brick and mortar store close to my home. I placed my existing AT&T Sim Card in it and it worked beautifully.Pros of this Phone:1) This phone has the longest BATTERY LIFE of any cellphone that I\'ve ever owned. In the past I\'ve used \"Renewed\" Samsung Note Phones and the AT&T A71 5G Phone. They had up to about 8 hours of heavy use battery life.The A52 5G gives me 12 hours of HEAVY use BATTERY Life and I still have 15 percent left.2) The phone is very fast, no lagging ever.3) The screen is very sharp and clear. The brightness have 800 Nits maximum brightness so it is easy to read this phone in Direct Sunlight.4) WiFi, Data and More...This phone easily connects to WiFi and its very fast. I own a 5ghz/2.4Ghz AT&T Dual Band Router and when I\'m close to the Router, I get the 5GHz at 533mps...lightning fast! However, in the back of my home, it switches to 2.4Ghz, but it is still fast enough.** If you have an older 2.4Ghz Router this phone will receive WiFi plenty fast enough.** Data...have a AT&T 40.00 Monthly Plan with 15GB of Data  it shows 5Ge, and it gets the faster Band 66 most if the time...very  very fast! There is no 5G where I live yet, however in a few months, it will have 5G here, this is the main reason why I purchased this 5G phone.Camera is superb, it has 10 x Magnification. The pictures come out clear and sharp.5) It has a 3.5 Headset Jack and a SD Card Slot. The Flagship Samsung phones don\'t give you a 3.5 Jack, and some of the  Flagship Phones don\'t give you an SD Card Slot.Cons...Just one MINOR Con, It doesn\'t give you a built in S Pen, however, I purchased a Disc Style Stylus that writes similar to the Samsung S Pen, so now I can use Samsung Notes for my handwritten notes.* Update November 8  2021...This phone is still very fast on my home WiFi or AT&T Data. I\'m so happy that I purchased this phone!I highly recommend this phone.','2021-12-18 19:29:38',5,19,401),(211,'  I was thinking about knocking off a star because it would say to restart because the Micro SD card was removed when it wasn\'t. Even just sitting on a table it would say that. Most forums said it happened after the April update.  My Micro SD card is fine and when the error comes up and check my pictures they are there. I\'m using a 3 year old Samsung 256GB EVO Micro SD card from my old phone. Will probably upgrade to 512GB soon now that google put limits on photo uploads.  I still use Amazon Prime to upload photos since they are still unlimited if you have a Prime account/subscription.  So my pictures will reside on the SD card and Amazon Photos. Amazon limits you on videos though.Update: I put in a Kingston 512GB card and haven\'t had the error since. I placed the 256GB EVO back in my old phone and it didn\'t have errors.  Maybe the card has to sit perfectly snug in the tray?For T-Mobile\'s 5G I got 275Mbps down, 100Mbps in my house. Outside of the house I get 347Mbps down and 137Mbps up using the speedtest.net app in LA. You can turn off 5G if you want to. It\'s in settings.  When you are on Wifi it disables 5G.Update: I now get 776Mbps down and 82Mbps up inside my house. T-mobile called the next week and offered 5G home internet for $50/mo.Battery life is really good compared to my old phone that had a SnapDragon 845.I started setting it up with WIndows 10 \"your phone\" app.  It allows you to manage notifications, messages, photos, and calls from Windwos 10 if the PC and phone are on the same local network (phone has to be on wifi, not cell data). It\'s a great way to copy and paste text messages and manage/copy photos from the phone to my computer. Then I noticed I could mirror the screen (interact with my phone from my computer) and use my phone\'s apps in Windows 10.  Some apps like some games won\'t work but I\'d say 90% of them do.  I tried to do the same with my wife\'s Pixel 4a but it wasn\'t there. I found out that it\'s only for the majority of Samsung phones and it\'s called link to Windows.  You can do the screen mirroring with 3rd party software with other android/iOS phones but this built in feature is very fast and seamless and high resolution.This phone is very similar to a Pixel 4a 5G. The Pixel 4a 5G has a very small advantage in pictures but not by much.  This A52 5G has better macro photos.  The Pixel 4a 5G has a much brighter screen if you use your phone a lot in direct sunlight.  I found the screen to be very good but I\'m not in the sun very much. I went from a 1440p screen to a 1080p screen and it\'s noticeable but I got used to it.The speed of running apps and games are very similar to my Snapdragon 845 phone but with longer battery life.  If you don\'t play a lot of 3D games then the processor is more than enough.Stereo speakers sound clearer. It won\'t replace my land line or work handset speakerphone just because they have larger speakers but it\'s good.Back to the camera it is very good.  Similar to a Pixel 4a 5G but Samsung has their own camera app and it\'s better. There are fun snapchat filters and AR (augmented realty) you can use without using the snapchat app.  Similar to using the snap camera app in Windows 10. Being able to change from close up to normal and widescreen are very seamless and handy.  I didn\'t to videos yet but examples on youtube show the stabilization on the Pixel 4a is a lot better so if you like to take 4K video while walking you should get something else. there is digital stabilization but you can only do that in 1080p.  Reminder, Google still gives Pixel owners unlimited photo uploads for now.The Samsung UI takes getting used to. I\'m used the Android One or just plain Android 11.  It has a few small things that are convenient that make it \"smarter\".  There are a lot of small things so you\'ll have to look at a review on the Samsung UI.I thought the punch hole selfie camera would bother me but my mind ignores it as it is on the side and small.  I only notice it when watching videos full screen but I often concentrate on the middle of the screen anyways.If you want unlimited photo/video storage, brighter screen, and slightly better camera performance get a Pixel 4a 5G. It\'s the same price.  If you like the link to Windows feature, better day time photos, keeping your media on a micro SDXC card then get the Samsung. I think the Samsung A52 5G will offer slightly better battery life.Only things in the box are a 15w charger, 4ft USB A to C cable, and SIM card ejection tool and some small manuals.  I think this comes with a 2 year Samsung warranty.  Both phones have the same IP waterproof rating. Something you usually don\'t find in mid-range phones.I can\'t say much about the fingerprint reader. I don\'t have many ridges let on my fingers so no sensor can accurately read my fingerprints. This affects heavy laborers and asians who don\'t have deep finger print ridges. It doesn\'t matter how accurate it is, it won\'t work if your ridges aren\'t deep enough. Even the expensive ones at work have a hard time.','2021-12-18 19:29:38',5,18,401),(212,'  EXPANDABLE STORAGE AND 3.5MM JACK I slept on this  phone the whole time I was shopping simply because I never liked Samsung\'s jank phones. But after scouring the market trying to find a phone that offered at least half the value they charged you for, I settled on the LG V60 (RIP LG phones), which wouldn\'t work on my network because of some bs proprietary technology (it seems like we\'re evolving backwards, innit?) It wasn\'t until I was going mad with rage at the consumer electronics market that I checked this phone out, and while I don\'t care for the UI, it\'s got all the hardware I need for an almost reasonable price. It basically cost the same as my G6 did, but comes with a better display and camera.Display is sweet, I like you can turn off 120hz to get more out of your battery, but I consistently run 120 with netflix, some social media-ing, and a fair amount of picture taking and the battery lasts me about a day and a half (I went to work with a full charge at 6am this morning, it\'s 11pm now and I\'ve got 45% left with me having binged watched netflix for at least a few hours while browsing the web)Camera isn\'t top of the line, but it is pretty dang crispy. Focus is fast, you can quickly adjust WB, has a fair amount of shooting modes and image processing. My biggest quirk is, and this may just be my eyes, but depth seems a bit off at times, like the background and foreground blend a bit. Night shooting is pretty clean, and has better zoom than any phone I\'ve owned, but don\'t expect magic from a quarter mile away haha video is a little shakey, I would\'ve liked to have seen more stabilization,  but I can deal with it.Comes with android 10 but you can download 11 off rip.One other thing I liked about this phone is there isn\'t a whole lot of bloatwear that you can\'t delete. Even most of Samsung\'s and Google\'s apps can be deleted, which is great because I don\'t want em hahaOther noteworthy things:MicroSD up to 1tbIP68 rating-i actually already accidentally tested this at it was sweet, so save your rice for cooking, kids.Kinda hard to find a sweet case for it, there is no classic defender otterbox :(It\'s wide and tall, but offset by not being very deep. Two hander if you\'ve got small hands though.Final thoughts:Samsung still sucks, and I\'ll forever miss LG phones, but the specs you get for the price are really unmatched for what\'s out there nowadays. I really don\'t understand why you\'d buy a $1300 flagship that has the same display, a slightly better camera, and no expandable storage, no audio jack, no IP rating, and an equal or lesser battery. In my eyes, this is the only phone worth getting in 2021. If I hadn\'t found it, I\'d have just gotten a talk and text phone for work and just chalked everything else because smart phones are becoming more and more of a ripoff each year, and this was a REALLY bad year for them. Price gouging, proprietary tech locking you up, consumers will be at the mercy of the industry until we reclaim our buying power and refuse to pay for overpriced garbage','2021-12-18 19:29:38',5,8,401),(213,'  Perfect i did a lot of research.

I even went into the At&T Store and asked which models support it --- they didn\'t even have any..... I ended up finding a Google Pixel 3 - which per Amazon\'s  \"Ask and Answer\" was reported to have supported WiFi calling.  I work from home, in my basement..... and access to WiFi calling is essential.  I can\'t believe how hard it was to find a new cell phone with this feature.

When the Cricket SIM card, was inserted you immediately received message from Cricket telling you the phone is not compatible.  Your account is suspended i.e. you can no longer use the SIM card on any phones including your old one. You need to contact customer service to reactive your account but the reactivation is temporary.  Your account will be suspended anytime as long as you are using the incompatible phone before Cricket shutdown its 3G and switch to VOLTE network in Feb. 2022. Cricket does sell its own compatible Samsung A32 5G.  It\'s called Samsung A32 5G SE edition.  The phone sold on Amazon has the same model number, but is not SE edition. Hence this specific phone is not compatible and leads to your account suspended.

I mainly bought this not because of some sort of show-off or novelty, but because I wanted a phone that has bigger screen and easy to see and navigate when you use Amazon shopping, facebook or emails.  My eye sight isn\'t what it used to be when I was younger and I really needed a phone that has much bigger screen than traditional smart phone.That was the only reason for buying this expensive folding phone.As for the bigger screen, easy navigation, typing, reading...etc, it is absolutely great.  I do not have to use reading glasses, nor make the letters as big as possible.  For that, I would have given 5 stars.However, it has some other related issues.  Since it is a big phone, it is very heavy.  Also, since the screen is so big and also has another 6\" screen when it was folded, it uses up a lot of battery power and I can see it draining quite fast.  I guess that Samsung had to choose.  Make the phone bigger and heavier for bigger battery or make it as portable and slim as possible with less desirable battery life.It is a great phone for me and I am quite happy with it, but due to the weak battery life, I have to give 4 stars, instead of 5.','2021-12-18 19:29:44',4,5,403),(231,'  The phone is good overall,  but I like to point out some flaws.

One, and most obviously, was the price. At $599 ( the price on Amazon when I purchased it), it was an unbeatable deal. Another was the specs: Snapdragon 865 and 6gb of RAM was perfect for my needs. My old Galaxy S7 looked practically primitive when set against the S20 FE. And so, I decided to give a midrange phone a try.At first glance, the S20 FE seemed too good to be true. The screen, while not 4K, still looks great with the 120Hz refresh rate enabled. The rear cameras look incredibly good, nice and crisp. I\'ve done everything from web browsing and gaming to word processing and photography, all with minimal issue. Battery life is solid, but not the best in the market right now. You\'ll still be able to get a couple of days out of the S20 FE on 120Hz. Also, you can\'t beat the customizability of Android. With the option to install launchers/widgets plus a wealth of storage (and SD card support), you get a lot of choice with the S20 FE. The size, while much larger than I was used to, still fits in the hand really well. I would recommend getting a case and screen protector for this one though, as I have seen people shatter the screen with a single drop.But, if you\'ve been reading up on the S20 FE at all, then you know that there are problems. First off, the virtual proximity sensor on the phone is spotty at best. Testing it out myself, I had to be right on top of the sensor for it to detect my face. And for phone calls, that means a few more accidental muted/ended calls than usual. The face recognition and fingerprint scanner are also not great. I\'d say it works about 85% of the time, but when it doesn\'t, do you ever feel it. Adding on, the front-facing camera is pretty lackluster. Not bad, but it\'s not flagship levels by any stretch. You\'ll need to be in absolutely optimal lighting to get a decent picture out of it. So if you\'re looking for a phone to take selfies indoors with, I\'d look elsewhere.From what I\'ve seen, the standout complaint with the S20 FE is the touchscreen. And yes, my phone (ordered in early November) has the issue too. Pretty horrendous ghosting when testing it in the touchscreen test app. There\'s undeniably a hardware issue with the S20 FE. There have been updates since the phone released, but none have fixed it entirely; merely a band-aid on a bloody gash. The real question is: does it affect everyday use? Will you notice it every moment you use the S20 FE? The answer to both is no, at least for me. While I\'m sure it does affect certain tasks (most notably those that involve fast touches or 3+ fingers), I really haven\'t noticed it in actual use. Pinching/zooming with your fingers close together will cause the screen to jitter, but that\'s about all I\'ve seen. If that worries you enough to pass on the S20 FE, I don\'t blame you.It really is a shame that I can\'t give the S20 FE a perfect 5 stars, because it does deserve it in some aspects. But with these hardware issues, there\'s always the worry that time will make them worse. It\'s a genuine worry, I get that. But even with the problems, the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE is a pretty great phone. It really does feel like a flagship phone, but with a massive price cut and a few downgrades. Only time will tell if the problems the phone has will get worse, but for right now, I\'m more than happy with it.Edit (8/18/2021): I\'ve dropped my rating from 4 stars to 3 stars.It\'s been a little less than a year, and the issues mentioned above have started to affect daily use in a way that turns this from a great phone to an okay phone not worth your time. Okay, maybe not daily use, per se. But enough that it\'s starting to effect my initial thoughts on it.The amount of times this phone has turned on in my pocket because of ghost touches is insane. Every time I take it out of my pocket, it\'s opened a random app and input a few letters on the keyboard. And this is after adjusting the settings to stop these sorts of things. I turned off double tap to turn on (despite wanting that feature) and turned on accidental touch protection (which did absolutely nothing). I even made it so that the phone needed face recognition or a fingerprint to unlock every time I close it. But it just keeps happening. No software update really fixed the screen, as suspected. This is a pure hardware messup.Here\'s the cold, honest truth: the screen on the S20 FE is terrible. Worse than my old S7. Worse than even a budget android phone\'s screen. It\'s beyond comprehension. The virtual proximity sensor is also worthless. I almost want to give it the classic \"angry Amazon customer 1-star\" review, but I\'ll refrain. There\'s still good here with the chip, customizability, and great battery life, but that stuff can only get you so far.Here\'s my advice: don\'t bother with this phone. You can get a midrange smartphone for the same (or even a lower) price, with better specs. It\'s still not the worst thing out there and I\'m not tossing it in the trash just yet, but it\'s definitely the last Samsung product I\'ll be buying. So disappointing, but I couldn\'t keep this review a 4-star in good conscience.','2021-12-18 19:29:45',3,13,404),(244,'  Never again will I buy another Samsung phone.

Your touchs will be misread causing random inputs and jitter. This is a recording of how the phone is recognizing my inputs when using two fingers in alternating succession as well as when swiping with two fingers. This effects everyday use in subtle but frustrating ways. From taps being read as scrolling to unplayable multitouch games, the screen makes me miss my 3 year old galaxy S8. The most recent software update to fix the issue has made no difference. If you buy this phone it WILL have this problem. I was originally in the group that assumed mine wasn\'t affected, but it became hard to ignore the signs after a week.','2021-12-18 19:29:45',1,19,404),(246,'  Just got this yesterday, the day it came out. I got the Navy Blue, which looks great. I got it to replace my 1st generation Pixel XL. Because the Pixel\'s battery was old Google stopped supporting security updates, I decided to upgrade. I thought about a Pixel 4a, but when I saw this phone in online comparisons and its 120hz screen, huge battery, and top-of-the-line processor for $600, that seemed like too good of a deal. While the OS is gussied up a bit from what\'s in the Pixel line, it\'s not hard to figure out the differences and it adds a slight premium feel.The only negatives in comparison to the Pixel are the camera software isn\'t as good, and the price is greater: $250 more than the 4a and $100 more than the 4a 5G. I had to look hard at my criteria to justify the extra cost, but I feel that the Pixel software doesn\'t add enough to the photos and that the extra cost gave me a phone with the kinds of features that will tide me over an additional year that the Pixel phones--with their weaker processors--likely would not. If anything else, it should have decent trade-in value in a year or two.','2021-12-18 19:29:45',5,7,404),(247,'  When I pre-order the description was 8 GB Ram but I received with 6 GB.

Really stinks that an issue this big slipped through. Samsung has released 3 software updates trying to fix it, but still have problems with jittery scrolling, accidental touches, etc. This isn\'t something that can be fixed with an update in my opinion or it would be resolved by now. Look elsewhere, or if your brave chance it I guess. I thought I would get lucky despite all the bad reviews/complaints (check samsung forums).

It both met and exceeded my expectations, and is truly worth the money. My son is now leaving on his own to pursue manhood. I wanted to give him a few fine gifts that would be practical, yet meaningful, that he would always have and use and perhaps pass down. This was one of those gifts that I was proud to give him. It needed to be all real wood, to be large enough, and to have separate compartment areas to hold his keys, wallet, change purse, tie pins, cufflinks, personalized writing pen, watches, and fine jewelry, and it needed to have charging areas for his phone and other electric devices. I looked at many different ones, but was unsatisfied with the cheap quality of wood, and I disliked the \"open desk tray\" or \"kitchen drawer tray\" look of many. I was unhappy to pay $30-$60 on these \"cheaper\" products that had no unique craftsmanship and looked so dull and \"generic.\" Then I happened into this fine Mahogany valet and was instantly charmed. It has all the needed space for items described above, plus it has charging ports and space to place up to three electronic devices in it, such as his phone, charger, and gaming device or camera. We like the storage areas in the top and drawer, and my son was pleased to find that the back of it could be easily removed to \"hide\" a few extra small items, too. The finish is beautiful, and the top storage floor is crafted in a lovely and handsome design. Also, it is not too heavy or bulky, but is still built \"solid.\" My son was elated with it, and my husband looked a little jealous, giving me the idea of getting him one for our 28th anniversary. Obviously, anything this fine that I would buy multiple times is something I could recommend easily to anyone hunting for an attractive, high-quality crafted valet with rare design and a better-than run-of-the-mill design.

The item arrived damaged due to poor packaging for shipment, but even it it wasn\'t damaged, I would still return it.  It it not solid wood and the wood finish is barely that.

I do feel as though it is slightly overpriced for what you get. However, it is an official samsung case so you know you are getting great quality and fit. The adhesion on it is great, no problems and it can easily be removed, however be aware that you will have less adhesive properties when you put it back on. Overall, its great, just a bit overpriced.','2021-12-18 19:29:53',3,3,409),(285,'  I only used the Samsung cover only. It uses all the option the phone offer. But this? One and a half piece of plastic. It work but I think it is not worth the price.

The phone was not brand new!!!! someone have already manipulated it!!! There was not protector film on the inner screen, the protector film on the outer screen was off set really bad and the device came folded inside its packaging!!! (it comes unfolded from manufacturing) and last but not least, when inspecting the lid of the box I could notice that someone did some hand cutting inside in order to make the lid fit with the phone folded... This is extremely disappointing, not sure who to blame either Motorola or Amazon!!! I received no headset as well','2021-12-18 19:29:55',4,9,410),(290,'  I have been waiting a long time for a \"flagship\" moto.  Really, I have missed Moto so much that I just wanted a OLED moto w/ a headphone jack.  But the Edge seemed to check a lot off my list.  Unfortunately I have been dismayed with what I received...  NO OPTION FOR WIFI CALLING.  :( ... a few perplexing things on Moto\'s part.-Buggy out of box -OS must have froze/shutdown several times trying to do normal setup-Case provided falls off phone-Case way to large to fit on phone. Basically useless. Falls off if you go to grab phone by case. More dangerous than not having one at all-Finger zoom-For some reason I cannot zoom on normal pictures, text, ect. Very odd. I have an LG, several Motos and a XIOAMI phones next to me where I am able to zoom in apps, web pages where the Edge I cannot. I don\'t understand this at all-NO OPTION ANYWHERE FOR WIFI CALLING- This may be the dealbreaker. I have LOTS of android phones including about five Motos (going back to G4) and they all at least have the option for Wifi calling (depends on carrier if it actually works) but the Edge does NOT even have it as an option. WHY MOTO, WHY???-I love gestures and they seem to work fine but what it the One Button Nav for?  It\'s still taking screen space but doesn\'t do anything? Very odd.If anyone is having these issues and it\'s human error - PLEASE LET ME KNOW - I really, truly hope my issues are human error, specifically the WIFI CALLING.  Please, anyone, let me know if you have any info regarding.  Thanks!UPDATE- After I sent this review, went on XDA and Motorola forums; I was told to root among other things.  I did notice the battery life from the time I took out of the box was not near as advertised.  After a few hours from a full charge I was on 20%.  I thought perhaps it was bc I was setting up, downloading apps, ect.  Day 2, I intentionally only started the phone, took SIM out and put in another for my driver that day (No wifi calling with ATT so cannot use at work).  Phone just say on my desk all day and with a full charge, by 3pm it was down to 40% - NOT BEING USED.Then yesterday I noticed the screen developing a purple \"bruise\" on the side.  It kept flickering and eventually grew so much it went into my main screen.So, this phone has been a complete mess since taken out of this box.Thankfully Amazon made it simple for me to get a replacement which I did.  I truly hope I received a lemon.If my replacement has the same type issues, then....I will update.','2021-12-18 19:29:55',1,14,410),(291,'  So just like the reviewer before me, when I opened the box the clamshell was closed and the sticker was lazly hanging on to the outer screen. \'Rushed\' would be the word I would use to describe how it looked if speaking to a blind man. But no scratches, dents or fingerprints. According to the Motorola unboxing the Razr is upright and presented nicely, not hastily thrown in a box and shipped.As for the phone itself: Awesome. I am so far happy with my purchase. I preferred this color over the the blush and mercury (att only) because those colors look 2 tone. Meaning, top half (second screen) is different color than the body. This graphite color blends in nicely with it\'s black top half.Call quality has been great so far. At the other end they told me they could hear a definite difference (galaxy s9). I also got to do a video conference, smooth baby smooth. Thankfully I did not misplace the usb to 3.5 jack.....yetThe phone feels a little stiffer (opening clamshell) than what I was picturing in my head. I thought back to the days of the V3 and this 5g version flirts with feeling. Genie, I wish for this to have a ui option that looks like the old V3 layout when making a call..Genie,Christina?? Update: I found it.I like having a satisfying [snap] when I end a call. I don\'t get that from [push the red button].It is like those new Chevy BelAirs that you can only get from certain mechanic shops. New chassis, modern technology, old great lines body style. This phone is made to kick up the nostalgia and it will \'roadhouse\' kick you and everyone around it. That is...if you had a Razr 15 years ago. But so far, I have been given complements and younger people want to know more information on the second screen; when they see me typing and watching YT on it.Battery: I\'ve only had phone for a few hours. Would it be nice, yes but I rate it \'eh, don\'t bother me\'. If your a heavy user, check the professional reviewers.Setup was easy however I did not finish it yet. I\'m like mostly through it. Android 10 is easy to work with. Cradling the phone in my hand(s) feels nice while I type (or swipe) on the keyboard. FP scanner integrated into Motorola symbol is a nice and refreshing touch.Pictures: The first is the speed test. 6pm on a Monday in Vegas. 5gE. The others are some taken around town. No filters, just normal and pro mode. I did try \'enhance\' on one and crop photo on two. I am not a picture guy so again try a professional review if that\'s your thing. Oh an animated smiley face on the second screen is a nice little touch.Scrolling: You can feel a little divot/bump/indent when your finger hits the middle of be the screen but it\'s barely noticeable unless you want to find it.Thanks for reading, AMA if your on the fence.','2021-12-18 19:29:55',3,17,410),(292,'  Unbelievable. Received the phone in the same conditions as described in other reviews. Folded, with no film on inside screen and crooked film on outside screen. The screen shows very distinct marks from foldings. But besides packaging issues, the primary reason that convinced me to return the device, that I haven\'t so far read in other reviews, is that the screen squeaks when opening and closing. It seems that the cheaper US price may be justified by a batch with subpar level of quality. I cannot believe the Motorola guys are setting themselves up for failure again after the poor device they launched last year. Very disappointed given all the anticipation and purchase on day of launch. One star is being generous for such an expensive device.','2021-12-18 19:29:55',1,20,410),(293,'  UPDATE 5 (8/26/2020): Ultimately, a return.It\'s sad to say but I am returning this phone. While it was replaced by motorola the screen is starting to exhibit a graininess or splotchy issue at low light. I just can\'t trust this phone nor it\'s screen to last past the year warranty. The edge is also not something that I can really put up with long term. Watching videos just doesn\'t feel right on a curved screen.Maybe this phone is for you, maybe I got two duds. Either way enjoy what you like but keep an eye out on your own device.UPDATE 4 (8/17/2020): Patience is strong with this phoneThe replacement phone that Motorola sent me does not have any screen issues 6 days later. People are reporting that the issues usually occur within the first 2 - 3 days so I think as long as it doesn\'t show any issues after a week you may be ok. It\'s still very hard to swallow a potential screen issue at the full retail price or any price for that matter. For those of us that purchased it at the discounted rate when it first launched, It is a good value still to me.However, if you need a phone that does phone things and are not a power user or don\'t really care about 5g (Which you shouldn\'t really unless it helps your coverage in rural area\'s), the Pixel 4a is my recommended pick. Or wait til the Pixel 4a 5g comes out which should have the same chipset.UPDATE 3 (8/11/2020): The dawn of a new phoneWell Motorola overnighted me a new a phone. You can see the difference in the screen quality. We\'ll see if the new phone experiences the same issue. Should start showing after a few days of use.UPDATE 2 (8/10/2020): The Motorola Replacement SagaI reached out to Motorola about the phone issue. There are A LOT of reports of the green tint issue on the screen on low light. It\'s possible the first batch is faulty so if you do get a replacement from Amazon directly it may not be better. Hopefully the replacement phone has a fixed screen, however if the 2nd replacement is faulty this will be returned to Amazon for a refund. People are reporting if you\'re ok in the first 3 - 4 days your screen is fine but this is just... not acceptable for the price.UPDATE 1 (8/5/2020): (Keeping original review below this)After using this phone for little more over four days, it is exhibiting issues similar to the Moto Edge + with the display. The display has a green tint to it at night under low light conditions. It\'s almost like a green haze and it\'s the upper half of the display (See attached photo). This makes sense as it uses the same display panel as the Moto Edge + which also has the green tint issue on some devices. If you encounter this issue it\'s possible it could be fixed via software but I would request a new device through Amazon or Motorola or just return it.(Original review):TL;DR - If you like to listen to music through bluetooth, there is a quirky fix that you may need to do if the music sounds flat or is missing bass.If you enjoy listening to music through Bluetooth, this is a bit of a mixed bag. There is an app called Moto Audio that always has an EQ and some weird tuning for any audio output through Bluetooth. It makes music sound incredibly tinny and flat and just plain awful. USB-C adapters or headphones plugged into the headphone jack disables this EQ however. There may be an option to disable the Moto Audio for bluetooth in the app itself, but the EQ may still remain. To fix this, plug in a pair of headphones either through the headphone jack or the USB-C port, and then unplug it and go back to your Bluetooth. The sound should be back to it\'s full and normal sound. Not sure if I got a weird bug but it the EQ continued to persist on my phone even with it being disabled initially.Otherwise it\'s a very nice phone. The screen is pretty vibrant and the 90hz refresh rate is nice. VoLTE and WiFi calling are working on T-Mobile through Straight Talk which is great. You\'ll be able to use this phone when T-Mobile phases out 3G calling starting on Jan 1st 2020. Also getting a 5G signal which is cool.No issues with the finger print sensor, works well with a screen protector (plastic) applied. The supplied case is nice as well since there are limited options available for this phone.The speakers are quite nice and loud too, music sounds pretty clean through them.With phones becoming more and more expensive, this is a pretty nice phone for the price. Sure there are cheaper phones but the 5G support, 765G Chipset, headphone jack, some water resistance and the design, I\'d say this is a good mid-high range phone.','2021-12-18 19:29:55',1,20,410),(294,'                    The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\n   ***UPDATE 9/12/20 FOLLOWING MULTIPLE REPLACEMENT FAILURES***Back when the Samsung S7 Edge came out, I wanted it so badly - but couldn\'t afford it. A few years later and my current LG V20 is starting to get a little slow, and a new EDGE is available for $500 (presale price)? I\'m all over this! Both of my parents bought it as well (they were both using the Samsung S7 - not the Edge version - which at this point are largely unusable), so I have three separate experiences with the exact same phone to compare. NOW ACTUALLY FIVE AS OF 9/12/20.Initial physical setup was a breeze. The SIM card slot (which also houses the SD card, if you have one) pops right out with an enclosed pin. The SIM and SD card connector faces the back of the phone. Slide it right in, and you\'re all done. The phone booted up just fine, and was at about 70% charge when I received it. It\'s a BEAUTIFUL phone, with vibrant colors and VERY smooth operation of the screen. I miss the app drawer, but I can live without it.Initially I was unable to receive text messages on Verizon, although every other function worked perfectly in every way. All three Motorola Edges had the same problem - all on Verizon. After several days of troubleshooting, my dad reached level three tech support at Motorola, who tied in with level two tech support at Verizon, and they figured out that Verizon needed to \"check, un-check, and re-check\" \"something\" in our account settings in order for text messages to be received by our phones. Once Verizon completed this cycle, text messages were fully functional instantaneously for all three of us. I was hoping that was the only issue... alas, I was not so lucky.A few days later, the screen started to develop a purple \"bruise\" on the left side, as described by MANY other reviewers. The next morning it was back to normal, but by the end of the day it was doing it again, and was worse than the prior evening. The next morning it was back to normal again, but 30 minutes later the bruise showed up again.I called Motorola tech support that afternoon. I had some difficulty understanding the woman I spoke with due to her accent, but I understood the majority of what she said. I was told that software technicians are aware of the problem and are working on a patch in the lab, and that when it is done it will be pushed to the phones automatically. I asked for a timeline, and was informed that they cannot say - which makes sense because you don\'t want to open a liability door for misleading customers, but at the same time I really needed an answer in some form. No answer was to be had, though. This was two days ago.By that evening, the lower left part of the screen was entirely blacked out, the bruise had spread to covering most of the left half of the screen, and had started on the right side as well. The next morning it was better, but only half-way so. Again the phone was unusable by that evening - which was last night.This morning the phone had improved by maybe only 25-30%. By 1:30 pm, not only were parts of the screen blacked out, but the bottom of the screen started flashing white and was non-responsive to touch (see attached pictures and video).I completed a master reset on my Motorola Edge, but the problem still persisted even after the phone was erased. At that point, I requested a replacement from Amazon. Thankfully my LG V20 still works just fine, so I have a fully functional backup until the new phone arrived.As my dad says, such a high failure rate is unexpectedly high for a new product launch. OTHER than this debilitating screen issue, I LOVE the phone - as do both of my parents.--------------------FIRST EDITThe first phone lasted one week before the failure as described above. The replacement lasted two weeks before the \"bruise\" showed up. By this time my dad\'s Edge had also started to fail. My mom\'s Edge, however, is still going strong. So the failure rate is now 75% (two for me, and dad\'s).Review is demoted from 3 stars to 1. If the screen doesn\'t work, the phone doesn\'t work. The phone is otherwise literally perfect. But if you can\'t use it, then it doesn\'t work. Period. I returned the replacement for a full refund. I\'m heartbroken.--------------------SECOND EDITMy dad\'s replacement Edge lasted less than 2 weeks before that screen started to fail. Out of the FIVE Motorola Edge phones from me, my dad, and my mom, only my mom\'s has yet to develop screen failure. That is a whopping EIGHTY PERCENT failure rate. Both me and my dad have reverted back to our old phones, and will be shopping for a new NON-Motorola midrange phone soon.','2021-12-18 19:29:55',2,13,410),(295,'  Yes unbelievable. Received the phone in the same condition as many of the other reviewers. Phone was folded without the screen protector and with finger marks.','2021-12-18 19:29:55',2,17,410),(296,'  Edit11/12/2020:I\'ve had to drop this thing to one star. Ever since owning this, the 5ghz wifi is bad. Android Auto loses connectivity constantly unless you use Motorola\'s solution - a 6\" cable. Yep 6 inches. While at first there seemed to be an interest in finding a solution through Motorola, our pleas have been basically abandoned. No issues like this on my Note 9. I am saddened as the phone is nice, but an old version of Android, failing Android auto, and terrible wifi plagues this for it\'s price.End EditI badly want to make this 5 stars but there\'s just a few things with it where it doesn\'t pull through. That being said, I actually would not have chosen a different phone if I could have.Pros:-The flip! It sounds stupid, but there\'s something about the screen and the flip of it. It decreases it\'s size wonderfully and it\'s nice having that form factor.-Build quality. This thing, the design is fantastic. Engineering is wonderful. There is no slop whatsoever and I love that. They cared about this device-5g support. Not much to say there.-Camera. Quad pixel is awesome. In the end the photo is 12mp, but it uses 48 to create that. Results are fantastic.-No bloat! This has a legitimately clean Google OS with no bloat, it\'s awesome.-Comes with usb-c to 3.5mm headphone jack.Cons:-Price tag. For a smaller battery, not top of the line hardware, it has a top of the line price.-Wifi card in it is definitely crappier than my note 9. Cellular is fine.-OS. It is released with Android 10 and still on it-No wireless charging. For a phone this pricey, wouldn\'t have taken much.Things to note:-The folding screen does leave some feelable creases in the screen. You can\'t really see it when the screen is on though. Might REALLY bother some people. Doesn\'t bother me at all.-They probably could have decreases the price by $100 by just shipping it in a normal box. That being said, it was a fun unboxing.','2021-12-18 19:29:55',4,5,410),(297,'  Update 8/21/2020: Noticed some black dots on the bottom left of the screen which remain no matter what is on the screen.  Sometimes a light green or pink blob can be seen behind them. Was this phone model rushed to market before it was quite ready?  Returning.Update 8/18/2020:  I\'ve now had the phone for 18 days and am becoming disappointed.  The size is longer than I like; top-heavy in a back pocket, very large for a purse,  and with wallet cases not available until Oct-Nov. I\'m about to put my phone chips back in my Moto 4.  I did get a flexible case in order to attach a strap through its hole for the jack, but there\'s nothing to protect the screen so can\'t carry in a pocket.  The rear cameras are too close to the phone\'s edge, making it difficult to get a landscape-mode photo without a finger showing at the top where it\'s holding the camera.  I\'m also having great difficulty getting the camera to actually take a photo when I press the button. Sometimes it does, sometimes it just puts a frame up on the screen or other such thing and doesn\'t take the photo.  It\'s also taking photos without the button being pressed (delayed photo? No timer is on that I know of) Came home yesterday with about as many photos of feet, thighs or table legs as intended shots.  At first I could zoom in or out, but it\'s in some setting now where I can\'t do that, and I can\'t figure out how to just get to a normal, auto format.  I\'m looking for a user\'s manual for the camera but haven\'t been able to find one.  When on the internet, sometimes a page will jump; just wiggle like crazy; and the only way to stop it is to back out of the page.  What I thought were good instructions in the Moto app aren\'t showing up for the camera.  This phone will be going back if I can\'t find satisfactory instructions for the camera.It\'s a pretty phone if you like the size, and the features are plentiful but possibly too complicated for me.  This is not your grandmother\'s phone.  (I\'m an early-adapter 69 year old.)Original review: I\'ve been reading reviews of phone cameras for months, and had been waiting for the Iphone 12 to come out in hopes of getting an Iphone 11pro at an affordable price.  Then this phone was announced. The Motorola Edge has all the camera features hoped for, AND much more storage than an Iphone.  What I couldn\'t figure out from the listing was whether the 256 Gb was internal storage or what could be added with a mini SD card.  It turned out to be both. There\'s 256 internal, AND a mini SD card can also be added!I\'ve had this a little short of two days.  The wrapped edge effect is very attractive, especially when using it to see how far charged it is, or for an enhancement for certain photos.  The wrapped edge can be turned off for specific apps so you don\'t have to read the news wrapped around the edges if you don\'t want. There\'s an action bar which is part of the screen on the right side of the phone that provides several navigation shortcuts.  It will take awhile to learn all the gestures to use this phone, but it has very easy instructions in the Moto app, so  I\'ll eventually learn to use the gestures and most of the phone\'s features.I especially like being able to open the camera with a couple of twists of the wrist, even before opening the phone with the onscreen fingerprint sensor.  I\'ve just taken a few photos so far.  They\'re very clear.  The portrait photo background blurs the background a little.  There are lots of photo enhancement tools to try, and the cameras were the main reason for purchasing this phone.  Unedited photos taken in the evening are posted.  The tilt of the camera changed the lighting considerably. The second photo was taken a moment after the first to level the railing.  It also changed the lighting color.  The third photo doesn\'t have any kind of filter.  It showed fuchsia on the screen, so what you see is what you get.  Lots to learn about the cameras, which will be fun.The phone\'s solar black color is  iridescent, giving a beautiful, subtle color glow to the back of the phone.  So far there isn\'t a case for the Motorola Edge (just for the Edge +) but that surely will be available soon. (Looking for a wallet case with a clear edge and a strap for attaching to a belt loop while in a back pocket.)The sound quality is excellent.This phone is more exciting than any phone I\'ve seen since my first smart phone; the Note 2; which was extremely difficult to learn to use.  It\'s a top-end phone at a mid-range price; especially if you can get it at the opening sale price.','2021-12-18 19:29:57',4,13,411),(298,'  Update: Had to return do to not being able to get Verizon LTE + or 5G. Also I couldnt receive Text messages.This phone is one of the best you can get at the price for a 5G phone. It is nearly identical to the Edge+ with a few differences. Its a big phone but slim enough to fit well in your hand. The edge display has minimal uses but it is good for some mobile games. I have some concern that if you drop it the edge display won\'t with stand a drop on a hard surface. Motorola will only update it to Android 11. Overall this is a solid phone for the price and specs.PROS* decent display* good battery life* 3.5 mm headphone jack* good call qualityCONS* in-display fingerprint sensor isn\'t the best* no wireless charging* camera is just okay* curved display limited','2021-12-18 19:29:57',3,10,411),(299,'  Very nice phone with a few caveats. First I am a consumer user not a business enterprise.The phone is fast, very nice screen, quality build with Android 10, no carrier bloatware. The big thing for me is the replaceable battery. Every new smartphone I have had to buy is because the built battery would not hold a charge and was a pain to replace. (I know I have done it myself).Now for some issues with setup.  There is no user manual available.  I went to the Samsung site and not there.  Therefore you have to stumble through by yourself.Inserting the SIM and SD Card.  The phone has SIM 1 and SIM 2.  for Verizon use SIM 1.  The SIM card is installed under the SD Card.  The slots are under the battery.  Turning the phone on is intuitive, push the button on the side.  Turning the phone off is not intuitive, the button does not work.  The off button is on the upper right corner next to the settings button, both visible after swiping down.  Transferring data and apps from your old phone is a snap, follow the prompts.Since this a Global phone when you turn it on it automatically selects the best carrier, GMS or CDMA.  What this means when you turn it on the first time it will connect but maybe not to Verizon.  Here is what you have to do.Go to:SettingsConnectionsMobile NetworkNetwork ModeManualNetwork OperatorsChoose VerizonNow you are all set and on the Verizon network. If you try to activate on line with the EMIE it tells you it is invalid however the phone is on the network and works fine.  I called Verizon and the only reason this happens is that the global phone is not yet in their EMIE database yet it will work fine (Verizon sells the same phone with a slightly different sub-model number).  The only thing you will notice is that on line under \"My Devices\"  you will see your phone number but no picture or model of your phone.Some have questioned say that the phone does not support WIFI calling, it does in fact support WIFI calling, to activate you have to enter emergency contact information.  I know this correct because I have it set up for WI-FI calling.  Just ordered an OTTERBOX from their website, 20% less than on Amazon with free shipping.Hope this helpful, great phone','2021-12-18 19:29:57',5,3,411),(300,'  I bought this phone for many of the reasons B. Rodgers cited in his thorough review. The phone is bigger and much heavier than what I expected [ UPDATE: but I got used to the bigger size and weight].Flagship phones are designed for obsolescence and cost twice as much. They have sealed-in batteries that typically fail after 2 years, and usually only promise 1-2 years of security updates. Since the Xcover Pro has Android 10 from the factory, it reportedly can support more thorough or lasting updates than Android 9 phones. The Xcover Pro guarantees 3-4 years of security updates, and has a 24-month warranty, whereas most phones offer only 12 month warranties and maybe 1 OS update.The battery can be swapped out before a new work shift, and swapped out at the end of its useful life, using only our bare hands. This phone is rugged, water resistant, and has good cameras; other phones with removable batteries have no water-resistance, low-end processors, and low-end cameras. I don\'t want to contribute to electronic waste, so I chose a phone that is designed to last. The ultra-wide-angle camera seems to cover about 135 degrees, so you can stand in a room corner and fit the whole room into the frame.It has a left-side button that can be assigned to any two apps via a long press or short press, and a top button that can be assigned to launch any two apps. The right-side power button can also be assigned, and I don\'t have to lift the phone off the desk to use the fingerprint reader that is built into the right-side power button.* Dictation without the cloudThis phone can convert speech to text internally, without sending your voice to the cloud. I confirmed this by dictating text into apps while holding the right-side button, even when I had the phone in airplane mode.* Wi-Fi callingI need Wi-Fi calling so I can place and receive calls without paying exorbitant roaming fees when I travel, while using my regular phone number. Although Samsung reassured me that all their phones including this one support WI-Fi calling, after purchase Samsung support told me that Wi-Fi calling requires cell-carrier bloatware baked into the phone\'s firmware. Consequently, if you want this phone to have Wi-Fi calling, the only option is to get a carrier version. In the US it is only Verizon, so you will have to put up with the worst customer service I have experienced in years, or purchase the phone from Verizon then use it on another network.* Point Of Sale (POS) transactions:Samsung claims that this is the only phone with EMV Level-1 compatibility: \"You can now accept payments without the need for additional hardware. The Galaxy XCover Pro has EMV Level-1 that makes it mPOS-ready.\" However, the Xcover Pro does NOT have MST (Magnetic Secure Transfer) hardware, and therefore does not support Samsung Pay for paying at point of sale (POS) locations.Samsung claims I can use Google Pay, but I have not tried that, as I do not want Google to log every transaction I make with my phone. Unlike other payment systems, Samsung Pay uses MST hardware on their most popular phones to make credit card transactions compatible with all POS magnetic strip readers.The phone does have NFC payment, which works only on POS systems that support NFC. So Ironically, the XCover Pro has more capabilities for accepting payments from other credit cards, but fewer capabilities for making payments with your own credit card due to lack of MST hardware.This unlocked Xcover Pro has powered down for no apparent reason, and self-reset numerous times. I don\'t know if that\'s due to any of my installed apps, though they were working fine on my older & slower Samsung phone. I\'m returning this phone and trying my luck with the Verizon version because Wi-Fi calling is essential to me. The Verizon XCover Pro is not self-resetting, but I have not yet allowed it to install the latest OS update, so I don\'t know if that will cause the resets.*** UPDATE on 2020-07-25: ***I purchased the $500 Verizon XCover Pro with a $200 discount to be credited monthly over 24 months, and an additional $200 credit on my first Verizon bill for porting my phone number to a Verizon Enterprise account. Obtaining a new account from Verizon was so aggravating I\'m not sure it will be worth the savings.1) As far as I know my Verizon XCover Pro has not self-reset. I\'ve had it for almost two months. I suppose I should restart the phone.2) If anyone has conclusively been able to get this unlocked XCover Pro to work with Wi-Fi calling, please reply to this review and let us know. Samsung told me Wi-Fi calling is not possible on an unlocked phone.3) If you have been able to get this phone at a discount from Verizon on a personal account, let us know.4)  Unsurprisingly, Verizon\'s custom bloatware on the Verizon version of the XCover Pro disabled the built-in FM radio. Carriers do this to push us into their data plan. So no emergency radio reception for when the towers are down or out of reach, and no radio feed without a data plan on the Verizon version.5) The FM radio on this unlocked phone was not disabled. However, I could not get FM radio reception using  the NextRadio app (all I heard was noise) even though reception was great on my nearby Android tablet using the same wired earphones as an antenna. Does the FM radio work on your XCover Pro? You you can install the NextRadio app and use wired earphones as an antenna.','2021-12-18 19:29:57',1,15,411),(301,'  I like this phone a lot.  I got this to replace a Samsung Galaxy S6 Active.  That six year old phone was the most trouble-free phone I\'ve ever owned going all the way back to the mid-1990s.  I\'ve been hard on it, but it still looks like a brand new phone.  I was reluctant to give it up, but the battery was giving out, the phone was spending a lot of time tethered to the charger, and the case is sealed so it\'s not easy to change the battery.  I decided to go with a new phone instead.The Xcover PRO is actually a lot larger and heavier than I was expecting, but I\'m getting used to it.  I unboxed the phone, put the battery in it and charged it up.  It took about 90 minutes for a full charge.  Transferring my old apps and contacts to the new phone was painless and was over in mere minutes.  I plugged in the SIM card and made a few calls on it.  It works fine on AT&T.  Battery life appears to be excellent.  I still have more than 50% at the end of the day, so I could probably get through a second day at work without having to recharge.  The camera gets some great shots.  I love the combo side key/fingerprint reader.  It\'s the perfect place to put it... right on the unlock button.Nothing too mysterious about this phone.  It took me a little while to puzzle out where the SD card plugs in.  Get a magnifying glass and look for the legend stamped in the case next to the SIM slot.The only minor gripe is that some of the stuff that this page says comes with the phone wasn\'t in the box I got.  It was all just minor stuff, so it didn\'t prevent me from using the phone, but I\'ll include it here so that the seller can correct their information on this page (or if it is correct, maybe they could just send the stuff to me).

My whole family is on a T-Mobile plan. T-Mobile is also one of the most accessible providers in the US when it comes to BYOD (bring your own device) phones, and every \"unlocked\" phone I\'ve ever had worked with their network, except this one. Data works fine over the 4G network but it\'s when you go to make a call that things get crappy. As soon as you dial out or the phone starts to ring for an incoming call, it switches over to 3G and you get all the quality of a 20 year old technology. T-Mobile was super helpful and bumped me to higher tier tech support immediately, but soon tracked the problem down to this model not being compliant with their VoLTE system, which is because Samsung didn\'t make the phone compatible with the T-Mobile network. No option of getting a network update exists from T-Mobile, because they\'re not the ones writing that code, Samsung is.Samsung\'s tech support was an embarrassing testimony to a behemoth in the cell phone world. Their business tech agent (this phone is part of their business line of devices) had almost no information in her system about this issue. In fact, the IMEI number showed up as being locked to Verizon while the phone\'s own  model number, software, and box all indicated it was an unlocked version. All the poor lady could do was recommend I go back to T-Mobile and ask them to make it work. T-Mobile also has a page where you can check to see if your device is compatible with BYOD, and entering the IMEI on that page immediately returns the message that the Xcover Pro is NOT compatible. All-in-all, the experience left me with a nasty taste for Samsung in my mouth. I sold my old phone the day before the new one arrived, but because of the incompatibility I ended up without a phone for three days, which in this day and age is horrible when you run a business and need to make and take calls, navigate to customers, and deal with emails on the run. The phone seemed great, but the experience was awful.The moral of the story is that Samsung is presenting this phone both here on Amazon as well as on their own website as an unlocked phone, which it is not - at least in the generally accepted meaning of that word. It may be unlocked from Verizon, but it\'s not compatible with a lot of other carriers. A customer shouldn\'t have to actually buy the phone to test it out or check it for compatibility (you need an IMEI number in most cases to do this). This information should be clearly presented by Samsung, and it\'s their failure that it\'s not. Shame on them!Edit to add: A lot of other reviews here mention problems with Wi-Fi calling, but I wonder whether some of the posters are confusing that with VoLTE which is like Wi-Fi calling but over the provider\'s data network. I personally did not have issues with Wi-Fi calling. It connected to my home network just fine and when connected, it used that connection for inbound and outbound calls (the LTE signal bars disappear when you\'re on a Wi-Fi network). It\'s the VoLTE part of the equation that\'s the issue with this phone on some carriers. It simply isn\'t capable of using many of the data networks for voice calls, which almost any other modern phone can do.','2021-12-18 19:29:57',5,10,411),(303,'  TL;DR: If you want an S-Pen, iPhone, or a phone to play PUBG on this is not your phone. Everyone else should seriously consider it.If anyone asks you what phone they should buy, this should be #1 on the list. It\'s not for everyone - but it is for everyone that doesn\'t know enough about phones to know why they need the latest Galaxy S, Note, Asus ROG, or other specialty or flagship phones.This phone is rugged, yes. but it looks almost identical to most every black rectangle out there. Nobody is going to look at this phone and think it\'s for construction workers. It\'s got a little extra on the corners, and a slight lip around the screen to keep the screen safer. It doesn\'t affect usability in any way.Why else should this phone be at the top of lists? There\'s so many good reasons:* Durability. Yeah, no phone is invincible, but being able to survive getting knocked off a table onto a tile floor is great (and the reason I had to replace my wife\'s phone).* Headphone jack. Yep, their loss isn\'t mourned or protested anymore, but it\'s nice to have.* Waterproof. Every phone should be.* User replaceable battery. This phone proves that there is no valid argument about phone thickness, bulkiness, or loss of waterproofing by offering this. It takes 5 seconds to swap a battery.* Expandable memory slot. Still on most phones, but this phone does it without giving up a second SIM card slot.* Dual sim. A lot of phones give up the memory card slot to have this feature. Not this phone. Put two lines in it, and a memory card.* USB-C. It doesn\'t have the blazing fast charging rates that the Note 10 has, but it\'s still fast.* Fingerprint reader in the power button. In-screen readers are still terrible (nearly unusable at times in my Note 10), this one is fast and accurate.* Modern Processor. The Exynos 9611 isn\'t their flagship processor, but it\'s a huge step up from what is put in most of the rugged phones out there. It\'s about equivalent to a 2018 flagship chip (Snapdragon 665) in terms of speed. Plenty fast for anything that isn\'t \"hardcore\" phone gaming.* IPS screen. Not a flagship OLED screen, but it looks fantastic, and better than standard LCD.* Gorilla Glass 5. Scratch resistant and tough.* Notification LED. I miss this on newer phones, but it has an LED so you can see if there\'s active notifications.* Regular and wide angle lenses.* Half the price of a Galaxy S20.Nitpicks (or the only stuff I miss from a flagship device).Tap to wake is not enabled by default.The holepunch camera hole is bigger than flagship phones.Single speaker instead of stereo.It might be larger than some people want.No Samsung Pay means you can\'t use it with old magnetic-only card readers.No 5G. This is a stretch, since few phones do have it.','2021-12-18 19:29:57',1,13,411),(304,'  Edit: I was able to find batteries for this phone from a retailer in the Netherlands which now makes this phone a 5.----The removable battery is what made me spring for this phone.  It\'s the feature I care about most.  I bet that if you\'ve stumbled upon this review you also care a great deal for this feature and don\'t want to get suckered in to buying a phone that needs to be replaced every 2 years.I have no complaints about the phone at all - it provides the perfect blend of functionality, performance and practicality the market has to offer at the moment.Despite this, the killer feature of this phone cannot be experienced if its removable batteries are not made available and at a reasonable price if/when they are.  The battery (GH43-04993A) appears to be available outside the US.  It is hopefully just a matter of time before they\'re available here.','2021-12-18 19:29:57',1,2,411),(305,'  While every online spec sheet lists FM radio, and this phone does have an FM chip, Samsung for whatever reason decided **not** to include an FM tuner app and the Next Radio app on the play store doesn\'t work.  So, if you we\'re buying this for hiking and wanted the FM radio (like me), you shouldn\'t buy this. From what I can tell Europe and Australia / New Zealand all ship with the FM tuner app.  Thanks for nothing Samsung!  $#&#) \'/\' %=/!?','2021-12-18 19:29:57',1,5,411),(306,'  I am an android phone user and have been using Samsung galaxy phones for the past decade. I started off with the Galaxy S3 moving to Galaxy S6, the Galaxy S8 Active ( my favorite so far) to the Galaxy Xcover Pro. I had to replace my S8 Active with a Xcover pro, because the S8 phone would not charge anymore in any way, and the Xcover pro was the closest match, even though it doesn\'t come close to the Galaxy S8 Active. Don\'t even know why Samsung has discontinued it.I purchased my Galaxy pro around a month ago on Amazon, which provided a 30 day return policy, however around 3 weeks ago, I started experiencing problems with my phone screen, the phone started restarting on its own, and I started seeing some white lines on my screen. Did not give it too much attention as I was very busy at work, and did not have any time to attend this issue.A couple days ago, the screen colors started fading, and the screen started acting up even more, tried calling samsung customer service yesterday but the hold times were over 2 hours, ended up giving up. This morning, I woke up to find the screen almost 90% faded, and the touch keys were not working, I was unable to use the phone at this point.I decided to take the phone to the nearest samsung electronics service center in Maywood NJ. The manager over there was very friendly, accepted to service the phone even though I had no appointment. Once I showed her the model, she told me that she wasnt sure if this model was serviced at this location, but still showed it to the Tech which then confirmed that there are no spare part available for this phone. I was then given the option to ship the phone to samsung and get it fixed under warranty, which would leave me without a phone for 7 business days!!! and that was my only option since I have no other phone to use ( Galaxy S8 wont charge). I refused and was then advised to call 1-800-SAMSUNGThis is when it gets even better, the service rep who picked up the phone was making it look like I was making this story up, and was trying to convince me that there was never a screen issue with this phone, and that this is the first time he hears this, I then asked to speak with a supervisor, which told me the same thing and was then transferred to case management. After two hours on the phone and 1 hour driving to get in and back from the service center, case management advised me to call \"U break it we fix it\" which is the Authorised repair facility for Samsung as mentioned by case management. I call their location in Westwood, and guess what?? They do not have any spare parts and I was then referred to the Service Center in Maywood that handles uncommon phones like mine. SO guess what, 3 hours later back to square one, I took a day off to resolve this issue.Bottom line is Samsung customer service is the worst!!! Will be duping this piece of trash in the garbage, and will purchase another phone with any other manufacturer that has an android platform.Thank you SAMSUNG','2021-12-18 19:29:57',5,19,411),(307,'  How I hate this phone let me count the ways:1. Phone is roughly the same speed as my S7 on latest update. A definite sacrifice.2. Phone doesn\'t support wireless charging.3. No always on display; closest I could get is a clock screen saver while on charger.4. And the doozy: phone is supposed to be \'waterproof\', only problem is the USB port insists that phone is wet even when it couldn\'t possibly be, like after charging to 100% over night and waking up to see the phone says it\'s wet.  Now once it says it\'s wet you\'re done because it won\'t charge and takes typically 8 hours to \'dry\'.  If you\'re on a mission or just on the road with maps, you\'re screwed.  Flush cache, restart, fan, vacuum cleaner, rice... Doesn\'t matter.  Yes, the phone allows you to replace the battery but who wants to do minor surgery every three hours and carry an external charger just because of a bug.Apart from #3, which in my opinion makes the phone useless for mission critical \'activities\' it works ok for someone, just not for anything I need a phone for.','2021-12-18 19:29:59',5,20,412),(308,'  Have had this phone for a about a month now. Works great and takes perfectly fine photos, BTW (better than what I had from Samsung four years ago). It\'s truly rugged, and has a snappy response to the apps and functions. The mono-speaker is just fine as a speakerphone, too, almost too loud for my 70-year-old ears. Battery requires just one charge in the early morning and keeps going all day (YouTube vids, music, exercise app, timer, weather, solitaire/checkers/chess... and all the other power-hungry apps I use), especially with the Android 10 features helping to monitor and manage power usage. Will order a replacement battery when they are available in the U.S., which means I can keep my phone running in tip-top shape for years! Thank, you Samsung for bringing back the replaceable battery, on this phone at least! Is it the ultimate smartphone in 2020? No. But it hits the sweet spot for me: all the functions I need, a great price, and a phone that will not die when the first battery gives out.','2021-12-18 19:29:59',5,2,412),(309,'  I\'ve been using this case since day 1 of getting my S21 Ultra and has been a great phone case everyday since. I recently got cutoff by a truck while riding my motorcycle whilr traveling about 45-50mph and wrecked pretty hard. My phone was attached to my motorcycle when it happened but was found 20-30 feet away from where the motorcycle came to a stop. The whole front end of my motorcycle was in pieces, all over the road like it had exploded, but surprisingly my phone had only a couple very small scratches on the bottom corner where the case had been slightly knocked off. Other than that my phone is in perfect condition, no cracks in the screen or dents anywhere on the phone. This is the only brand of case I will ever put my phone in after this and highly recommend anyone looking for a tough yet sleek phone case to get this case without hesitation.

This case feels comfortable in the hand. The case sticks up from the face of the phone providing protection if you decide to lie the phone face down. It does the same for the camera on the back. It provides a good grip for the phone, not slippery. The back is supposed to be kind of see through but it\'s really not so if you\'re looking for a clear case this isn\'t it. The buttons are great and they supply extra buttons green and blue buttons if you want to switch them out. Cut outs are exactly where they should be. The case is also thin. Doesn\'t add much bulk at all. Tech 21 says this case will protect your phone from a 12 foot drop. If it works even close to that then that\'s pretty exceptional. Oh and it doesn\'t interfere with a screen saver. The back gets a little smudgy but I\'ve seen a lot worse.','2021-12-18 19:29:59',5,11,412),(311,'  I have always ordered tech 21 cases because I love them this year they changed it up for my s21 ultra the edges are no longer grippy they\'re smooth and slippery which makes it harder to hold.

It lasted me and worked well for over 4 years.  I just got the Galaxy S21 5G (not the plus or Ultra) and bought the Tech21 case for that.  The case fits the phone very nicely. It snaps in and fits snuggly with no gaps in the seams. The case has a raised rim around the front so that the phone is not resting on the glass when placed face down (on a flat surface) as well as a raised rim around the cameras and flash when resting on its back.  The case is smooth yet has a good grip feel to it.

After a month of use, I\'m throwing it in the trash to buy another. Money wasted.To summarize its specs and how they actually are:- The screen is advertised as a big thing, but forget about it! You\'re never gonna get 90 Hz because the processor cannot keep up. Scrolling through messages or Instagram feed you see lag, so what\'s the point of a 90Hz capable screen if it lags and you see it at 30 Hz? Color accuracy is good though- The phone\'s performance is the worst I\'ve seen in the past decade! Forget about multitasking, with no open background apps, when I go to the supermarket I cannot switch between the shopping list app and the coupons app, because every time I switch the apps reload from the beginning. Screen lags, apps take forever to open, and I\'m not even talking about games. Never had such a slow and frustrating experience texting, as the phone can\'t keep up with my typing on the keyboard nor scrolling through threads.- The camera is absolute potato. Remember to grab another camera with you because this is the absolute worst. For fun I compared the camera with that of my previous phones, and found it to be mostly similar in various lightning conditions to that of my Sony Ericsson C901, released in 2009!!!- The battery is huge and great, I can get a full day of power out of the phone with no issue. If the phone wasn\'t so slow and I did not have to wait for a minute for snapchat to open or type messages over and over again until the keyboard keeps up, my screen time would be inferior and I bet the battery would last even longer.- The fingerprint reader is slow and makes mistakes more times that it unlocks the phone. Face scan is also pretty much useless, as it depends on the camera which is potato. The last time I had a phone without a biometric unlock was 2014. Today, I am dragged 7 years back in time to once again use passwords to unlock my phone. It\'s extremely frustratingSTAY AWAY!

Nor does it do much to address the risk of a tiny grain of sand or salt scratching the lens when so lain - the depth between the case surface and the lens surface seems measurable only in microns.

This leaves me scratching my head as to how Samsung could have taken case through R&D and been happy with it. Needless to say I now have a two tone case... Which I will be returning shortly.

I haven\'t really gamed on mobile before, but I\'m really having fun with what\'s out there. The screen is great and has the 120 fps option that few phones have. The only problem with 120 fps is that developers need to update their software to support it, meaning a lot of games/apps will still run locked at 60 fps, but that\'s not the phones fault. It\'s kind of funny that the S series now has bigger screens than the older note series phones, I still remember when the older notes were considered \"massive\" at 5.5 inches and now here with are with the smallest mainstream S phone at 6.2 inches.

I\'ve owned iPhones since the original came out more than a decade ago. I\'m also a developer and I loathed most of their developer policies, so I consider myself someone who appreciates good design and usability as opposed to your run of the mill fan boy. This whole review is from the perspective of someone making a switch.Hardware: The phone itself, while feeling substantial, is actually quite pleasant to hold and use. I had a popsocket wallet and case on my iPhone 11 which made it feel no lighter than this phone, sans case but with pop-wallet.  The phone is super fast, just as fast if not snappier than my iPhone 11. It has 12gb of memory, and from what I can tell, and it gets used. This is probably an artifact of running each process sandboxed but with iOS you literally have no visibility unless you apply a developer profile to the phone.Cameras: The cameras seem good, but honestly I think I prefer the iPhone better. For now. I don\'t really understand the different modes of the camera and I also don\'t understand why pictures look so much better after they are taken than when they are on the view finder. iPhone wins here, hands down. That being said: the iPhone seems like a great vacation phone. Simple and geared towards consumption and entertainment, with a great camera to boot. From the pictures I\'ve taken, I can tell this thing can produce great snaps however it certainly isn\'t as simple as on the iPhone. So while this will be a great \"urban life\" phone and hopefully will take those impromptu photos that occasionally pop up - the only ones I ever really share or look at again are ones from vacations, and I don\'t plan on using this phone on vacation.Battery: The battery seems to last a good amount of time, I definitely got a good 12-14 hour day under my belt with your typical \"this is a new toy\" usage. That seems more than acceptable, I just hope it lasts.The outer screen is very usable! Typing on it, even with my adult sized hands felt about the same as using an old iPhone, and while not quite as spread out as your normal phone, it\'s also much easier to operate one handed. Instead of going on and on about it, i\'ll just say this: I can pretty much do everything I need to do  on the outer screen alone - and while I thought I would miss the wider aspect ratio, it turns out pretty much everything we already do with our phones is set up to flow vertically; not horizontally.The inner screen literally made me chuckle a little and smile when I turned it on. It is amazing. Turn the \"tablet\" experience on in the settings to experience another smile and chuckle. It can get so ridiculously bright that it\'s probably a health hazard, and both displays offer the night mode familiar to iPhone users (you need to turn up the intensity to match the default Apple experience). It does have a plastic screen protector on it, which I understand you can have removed, but it doesn\'t feel fragile. The plastic protector does offer that \"sticky\" feeling every now (depending on the condition of your finger) and then, its best you keep it clean to prevent that.The folding mechanism: it is solid, it takes effort to close it and while I delicately and slowly fold it, there is absolutely no need. The mechanism feels deliberate and premium. It\'s also pretty silent, although I do hear a little static noise when I unfold it. I also thought I heard creaking noises, but it turns out that\'s the noise Android makes when you lock it.Flex mode: This is also great, also made me smile. One note, when you use this phone in Flex mode with the camera in the air (which is how you would need to use it to do a video conference), it is not properly weighted and often tips over on its own. I solved this with my pop socket/wallet, but I would have expected this phone to be balanced correctly, given that the Flex nature is marketed so prominently.Software & UX: Honestly, android is great. I downloaded all the same apps I had on iPhone (literally everything looks the same) plus some ones that Apple won\'t list on their marketplace. I do have to buy all my games again, which isn\'t ideal, but now I\'m covered on both eco systems.Androids method of organizing apps and the home screen independently is much more coherent than iOS (you can still switch to the iOS method if you wish) and adding Widgets is much more useful on Android than the newly introduced functionality on iOS 14.What isn\'t great about the UX:- There\'s literally no help for switching from iPhone. After reading the online user manual, I gathered there\'s a helper Samsung app to transfer content, but I haven\'t yet used this.- Both samsung and google apps: I get that Samsung wants to offer its own apps, and I honestly am not a huge fan of Google and their eco system, but why have both? Surely Google\'s offerings can be downloaded on request, and Samsung wouldn\'t include their own version if it wasn\'t fully baked - so why have two. It is so confusing and honestly I still haven\'t quite determined if both of them are sync\'ing my photos or contacts or what. This is where the Apple mentality really (only) shines - by tightly controlling the Applications on a users phone, they can offer a consistent and unified experience. Samsung\'s apps, except for Internet, work well enough as far as I can tell so why not just go with those? Having Google Photos and Samsung Photos is pointless, having Samsung Pass store my passwords and then also Google asking to store it? Really? Any non developer Apple user could easily suspect this is a scam.Purchase experience: this is where it all fell apart for me. The phone arrived late, despite pre-ordering the literal minute it was listed. People who pre-ordered from Samsung were treated to $150-$250 off the price of the phone depending on your effort, as well as Galaxy Live buds for free due to the delay. Thankfully, Amazon also made me smile, but...Samsung really needs to re-examine the strategy with this phone. People who buy a $500 iPhone can walk into an Apple store and get expert advice right then and there. I purchased this $2000 phone and had to figure everything out myself. When I needed support on how to get the Galaxy Z Premier benefits, not even Samsung support knew what I was talking about. Together we figured it out but this is not acceptable.The box includes a charger, a ~3-5ft cable, 3 pieces of paper roughly the same size as a napkin, and the phone. Plus three separate warnings about using the phone.  This is also unacceptable. It would have been great to include a case, or at least headphones.Bonus: Your Phone + Windows 10. This is like iMessage and iPhoto integration on Apple products, but just infinitely better. You can make and receive calls through the PC, send and receive text messages and notifications, and DO FULL REMOTE DESKTOP TO YOUR PHONE. What a time to be alive... It works remarkably well and even follows all my different Windows devices (desktop, surface book, tablet).Other observations:1. Super fast charging must be different than normal USB PD charging. None of my PD chargers can super charge this, other than the one that came with it.2. There are currently no cases available on the market for this phone3. Yes, it is pretty heavy - but so is your average accessory laden iPhone4. It is slippery! Pop socket or finger ring recommendedFinal thought: Android gives me hope for a more useful phone. Or should I say pocket computer. iOS users must not be developers, or they\'re lying to themselves when they claim to replace a PC with an iPad. I can program on this Android device. I can use a keyboard and mouse and USB-C hub with this android device. I can load programs that would definitely not meet Apple\'s criteria for listing simply because they offer competing functionality or expose too much of the OS core. This is a true PC replacement. Especially when you throw Microsoft\'s RDP on there or a Citrix client.I\'ll update this review in 2 weeks but these are my initial thoughts.Update: the camera seems decent but I\'m still not convinced it\'s better than my iPhone. I added some pictures I took from the roof.','2021-12-18 19:30:26',1,16,429),(408,'  This is insane. I bought it on a whim at best buy and I\'m not kidding when I say it feels like its from the future. I\'ve been a phone geek forever and it takes something special to truly blow me away and this has done just that. My only concern is that I\'ll break it. I know it\'s gotten stronger with this next generation but its 2000 bucks. It\'s honestly probably worth that too. I don\'t say that lightly.If you can pick up one and you don\'t mind a ding on your credit card I think it\'s worth at least trying. You can completely customize the outer screen and I need screen with different wallpapers, widgets and apps so it\'s essentially 2 phones in one. Seriously this is a magical device. Kudos samsung for daring to innovate and taking a chance. I feel like we\'ll be seeing more of this design factor for a long time.','2021-12-18 19:30:26',3,14,429),(409,'  Talk about the ultimate device for portability.  Use it as a regular phone, open it up and it\'s a tablet, computer, Xbox and everything folds up nice and neat and can fit in your pockets.As you can see, I opted for accessories to maximize the full potential for this phone. And truthfully I think everyone should do so bc it\'s basically what this thing is built for. It\'s to put the endless phone, media, gaming possibilities in the palm of your hands. Granted, I spent another few $100 for a real carbon fiber case, removable lock stand, folding Bluetooth keyboard, screen protectors, aluminum camera protector, game controller, etc. But if you can afford this phone, it\'s worth the extras, if you don\'t already have them to get the full experience.This is my first folding phone and I\'m glad it was because this phone is a masterpiece, just shy of absolute perfection. The cons being a delicate folding screen, no S pen, no hidden embedded camera in screen, etc. But really? None of those things seriously diminish the value and absolute powerhouse of device this thing is.It WILL eat up everything you throw at it and ask for more. It\'s fast. Smooth. Nearly anything and everything you can think to customize more towards your liking, it will do it and even suggest things you wouldn\'t have necessarily thought of. Considering everything it does you\'d think it would just DEMOLISH the battery. Yes and No. You can max everything out and just go ham and still get a good 6hrs or so. More conservative use and settings, you could get up to nearly 2 days on one charge. It all just depends on how you use it.One more thing, bc I could go on forever, is be prepared for the attention you will receive. Which I ran some numbers and if I\'m right, only .006% of the entire world\'s population owns this phone. Therefore it is relatively rare. So surprisingly, despite the fact that this phone was released over 6 months ago, a lot of people have never seen one in person. And I have not come across one person yet that was not just blown away just from the whole folding action, let alone everything it actually does. Just to kind of prove a point a bit, when I had to go activate this phone, neither the manager or associate had seen the phone first hand yet. Granted Metro PCS doesn\'t sell it, but I would\'ve figured being owned by Tmobile, and in a major city that I hadn\'t been the only one to come in with this phone. So those with MetroPCS, yes it works. 5G and all. It will NOT work right out of the box with your old Sim. You have to go get it activated.I lied. Last thing. I dropped my phone already and it survived so it\'s not as fragile as we might think it is. But that is why I strongly suggest getting the carbon fiber case. Super thin but strong. Not a scratch, crack, nothing. Like it never happened. And I dropped it on concrete from 3ft or so.','2021-12-18 19:30:26',5,1,429),(410,'  Camera could have been better.  and also need stylus and additional memory.','2021-12-18 19:30:26',5,7,429),(411,'  Glitchy phone, was giving me trouble from the moment I opened it.

One, and most obviously, was the price. At $599 ( the price on Amazon when I purchased it), it was an unbeatable deal. Another was the specs: Snapdragon 865 and 6gb of RAM was perfect for my needs. My old Galaxy S7 looked practically primitive when set against the S20 FE. And so, I decided to give a midrange phone a try.At first glance, the S20 FE seemed too good to be true. The screen, while not 4K, still looks great with the 120Hz refresh rate enabled. The rear cameras look incredibly good, nice and crisp. I\'ve done everything from web browsing and gaming to word processing and photography, all with minimal issue. Battery life is solid, but not the best in the market right now. You\'ll still be able to get a couple of days out of the S20 FE on 120Hz. Also, you can\'t beat the customizability of Android. With the option to install launchers/widgets plus a wealth of storage (and SD card support), you get a lot of choice with the S20 FE. The size, while much larger than I was used to, still fits in the hand really well. I would recommend getting a case and screen protector for this one though, as I have seen people shatter the screen with a single drop.But, if you\'ve been reading up on the S20 FE at all, then you know that there are problems. First off, the virtual proximity sensor on the phone is spotty at best. Testing it out myself, I had to be right on top of the sensor for it to detect my face. And for phone calls, that means a few more accidental muted/ended calls than usual. The face recognition and fingerprint scanner are also not great. I\'d say it works about 85% of the time, but when it doesn\'t, do you ever feel it. Adding on, the front-facing camera is pretty lackluster. Not bad, but it\'s not flagship levels by any stretch. You\'ll need to be in absolutely optimal lighting to get a decent picture out of it. So if you\'re looking for a phone to take selfies indoors with, I\'d look elsewhere.From what I\'ve seen, the standout complaint with the S20 FE is the touchscreen. And yes, my phone (ordered in early November) has the issue too. Pretty horrendous ghosting when testing it in the touchscreen test app. There\'s undeniably a hardware issue with the S20 FE. There have been updates since the phone released, but none have fixed it entirely; merely a band-aid on a bloody gash. The real question is: does it affect everyday use? Will you notice it every moment you use the S20 FE? The answer to both is no, at least for me. While I\'m sure it does affect certain tasks (most notably those that involve fast touches or 3+ fingers), I really haven\'t noticed it in actual use. Pinching/zooming with your fingers close together will cause the screen to jitter, but that\'s about all I\'ve seen. If that worries you enough to pass on the S20 FE, I don\'t blame you.It really is a shame that I can\'t give the S20 FE a perfect 5 stars, because it does deserve it in some aspects. But with these hardware issues, there\'s always the worry that time will make them worse. It\'s a genuine worry, I get that. But even with the problems, the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE is a pretty great phone. It really does feel like a flagship phone, but with a massive price cut and a few downgrades. Only time will tell if the problems the phone has will get worse, but for right now, I\'m more than happy with it.Edit (8/18/2021): I\'ve dropped my rating from 4 stars to 3 stars.It\'s been a little less than a year, and the issues mentioned above have started to affect daily use in a way that turns this from a great phone to an okay phone not worth your time. Okay, maybe not daily use, per se. But enough that it\'s starting to effect my initial thoughts on it.The amount of times this phone has turned on in my pocket because of ghost touches is insane. Every time I take it out of my pocket, it\'s opened a random app and input a few letters on the keyboard. And this is after adjusting the settings to stop these sorts of things. I turned off double tap to turn on (despite wanting that feature) and turned on accidental touch protection (which did absolutely nothing). I even made it so that the phone needed face recognition or a fingerprint to unlock every time I close it. But it just keeps happening. No software update really fixed the screen, as suspected. This is a pure hardware messup.Here\'s the cold, honest truth: the screen on the S20 FE is terrible. Worse than my old S7. Worse than even a budget android phone\'s screen. It\'s beyond comprehension. The virtual proximity sensor is also worthless. I almost want to give it the classic \"angry Amazon customer 1-star\" review, but I\'ll refrain. There\'s still good here with the chip, customizability, and great battery life, but that stuff can only get you so far.Here\'s my advice: don\'t bother with this phone. You can get a midrange smartphone for the same (or even a lower) price, with better specs. It\'s still not the worst thing out there and I\'m not tossing it in the trash just yet, but it\'s definitely the last Samsung product I\'ll be buying. So disappointing, but I couldn\'t keep this review a 4-star in good conscience.','2021-12-20 08:59:41',2.4,3,404),(418,'  I didn\'t buy this for gaming - just for normal daily work as I type a lot and wanted a better keyboard. The quality is obvious and I expect it will last for many years. The key action is very crisp, they\'re slightly indented so they have a good feel around your finger, and the plastic is nice to touch. All great things.For people that are interested in all sorts of different color schemes, I\'m sure they can get whatever they want - there are many built in options and then also the ability to fully customize.All of that said, I nearly packed the keyboard up and sent it back right (hence the 4 stars). The keyboard worked without the Swarm software, but there was no way to turn off the colors - only dim them or turn off the lighting completely. Without back-lighting, it would be very difficult to see the key caps so that\'s really not an option.After downloading Swarm and starting the installation, some Microsoft components had to be installed on my 64-win Win10 machine. That\'s fine, but then my PC hard rebooted without warning. After the reboot, nothing appeared installed so I started the process again. This time it went straight the Swarm software (so the MSFT components evidently completed), and that appeared to install without a problem, but then after starting Swarm the only option was to do a software update - and I had just downloaded the LATEST software available from their website!?Swarm didn\'t give me any real options other than to update again, but when I did that it appeared to hang and after about 5 minutes I killed the app. I tried to reinstall - ended up de-installing everything and then reinstalling everything again. Once again I was given the only choice of updating. As this caused a problem before, I went on-line looking for a manual or any information - there isn\'t one as far as I can tell, and there wasn\'t any information in the box other than to install Swarm!With nowhere else to go, I went ahead and updated my software once again, and once again the app appeared to hang. Fortunately I was called away for about 45 minutes as when I came back, the keyboard lights were off, I couldn\'t use it to log back in, and there were four white lights blinking on the bottom right of the keyboard. With no way to log in, I unplugged the USB, plugged it back in, and then the keyboard started back up and I was able to login.The screen in front of me had instructions to unplug and plug the keyboard back in as it had done a firmware upgrade! Unannounced. With no explanation. With no manual. With no help options discussing this.Roccat - in case it isn\'t abundantly clear, it is unacceptable to do a silent firmware upgrade! Please put some instructions up on your website - but that\'s the backup plan Swarm itself should tell users what it\'s doing and give a rough estimate of how long it will take. Had you done that, other than MSFT\'s hard reboot, installing the keyboard would have been a breeze.P.S. I\'ve enjoyed writing this review. The keys really do feel great and I believe I type faster on it.','2021-12-20 08:59:41',4,9,200),(419,'  I\'m not concerned at all with RGB features, and actually find them a bit off-putting and tacky. I bought this solely on the basis of the reviews of the keys and build quality. Admittedly I do love the feel of the keys, and it is a beautiful looking keyboard. However, it does have a few shortcomings and the absence of some common features seem like a bit of a missed opportunity....First off, the images make it look like it\'s built like a tank, with the lovely brushed aluminium top - however, it still has a bit of flex that I was not expecting. The hand rest attaches magnetically which is a nice touch, but it\'s very hard and not at all comfortable. The dedicated media keys are inadequate. I don\'t want to have to hit shortcuts to play/pause music. The volume control is nice but at a minimum I would expect dedicated skip, stop, play/pause buttons, in addition to the mute button. Pretty much standard on other \'premium\' keyboards. I\'m a huge fan of macro keys, but Macro keys via multi-key press shortcuts is completely pointless in my opinion. I use macro keys heavily on my other keyboards because I program them to replace otherwise additional key presses. I\'ll never use what they have attempted to implement here. Finally, they really should have included a USB port. Even if they couldn\'t make it a pass-thru type, I\'d happily deal with an extra connector at the end of the cable to get this feature.Overall, it is a very nicely presented keyboard and the keys are top notch. Unless a \'unicorn\' solution comes along, I have no intention of replacing the AIMO despite the absence of the features mentioned above. If you are in to all the RGB stuff, this has customizable features by the boatload and you will probably get more out of it than I do in that regard.So in summary, five stars for appearance and key quality, less one star for poor implementation of some features (media keys, macro functionality, hand rest) and for the missing USB port... and finally, less one more star for the price, which in my opinion is too high given the aforementioned flaws','2021-12-20 08:59:42',3,10,200),(420,'  Notes:- The RGB effects are very, very cool, completely love the design. The Roccat Swarm software used to control it also works as intended. Roccat swarm software can also be used to make macros and reassign keys. Nice.- About the RBG , one thing that bothers me slightly is that the intelligent lighting has a significant delay between keypress and light (approx 0.5 seconds, sometimes more. Just feels a little bit sluggish)- The titan switches feel very good. They are not loud at all but have a very nice mechanical actuation- The letters on the keys are not painted but rather they are spaces in the opaque layer where the LED lighting shines through. This makes it impossible to scratch off the letters, but also makes the letters not visible when the LEDs are turned off.- There is a knob on the top right for controlling both RGB brightness and volume. There\'s also a mute button. Both are very handy- The individual keys have larger than normal spaces in-between them. This requires a little bit of a learning curve. In the beginning my fingers were tripping over the edges of the keys. After a bit of practice I found myself liking the spaces more than I thought I would--it encourages better typing accuracy and actually feels more satisfying (maybe it\'s just me?)- Full size keyboard. I WISH they had a numpad-less version!Overall, incredible keyboard. A+. Recommend. Yay Roccat!','2021-12-20 08:59:43',5,7,200),(421,'            Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n        \n\n\n   I needed a high quality and \"all around\" keyboard both for productivity as well as gaming. I believe that you can have both but it\'s very hard to find something that can do both well especially at an affordable price point. Some of these keyboards can easily hit $250+ and by that point, are you sure you wanna waste your hard earned money on something you could easily spill a drink on and ruin in the blink of an eye?  When it comes to keyboards, there are so many options to pick from - membrane vs mechanical keyboards, normal vs low profile, and of course the various cherry mx switches (brown, red, silver, blue, black, etc). I think it took me around 2 days before I finally came up with personal preferences (you should probably do the same).  I went to microcenter and tried out the various keyboards they had on display (Corsair K70 / K95, Razer Huntsman Elite / Chroma, Logitech G915 / Pro X). I also took hours out of my day and listened to various YouTube videos on the differences between all of the cherry mx switches.I wanted something right in the middle - clicks not too quiet but not too loud, design not too aggressive looking but not too basic either, font something professional but also relaxing to look at, and something practical to use without running into too many gimmicks. I always preferred low profile keyboards because for me, the normal profile keyboards are too big, bulky, and in my opinion, a remnant of the 90s. After hours of typing and gaming, your fingers get tired of wrestling around with the keys. At the same time, you don\'t want a super sensitive keyboard either that registers a hit just as soon as you breathe in its general direction. For this reason I decided to go with the cherry red & brown switches (the best \"all around\" switches for typing AND gaming). Both of them have the same activation force (45cn) and are fairly quiet but audible enough, the only difference being, the brown switches have a tactile feedback whereas the red switches are linear. Think of this tactile feedback as a minor \"bump\" in the road to let you know the conditions of the road without actually seeing the potholes. Being a fairly confident typist, I decided to go with the cherry reds since the tactile feedback could in theory become tiresome over long periods of time. Keep in mind even with linear keys, you can still feel the key so it\'s not like you are typing on nothing. It comes down to more or less \"clicky\" feeling. Finally, the RGB lights. I had no real preference on them. They look cool but at the end of the day, they are just fancy lights you don\'t really need for gaming or typing.My research was complete so I dropped by microcenter. Keyboards everywhere, most of them the same generic 90s keyboards I dreaded using but with a price tag of $150 and above. One keyboard definitely stuck out above all others - the Roccat Vulcan. A sturdy aluminum plate, low profile keys with the switches visually exposed, and an overall sleek design with multimedia controls, I immediately knew I had to touch it.  I hopped on, opened a word document, and started typing. It didn\'t disappoint one bit. It performed just as well as it looked.  I powered through sentences as fast as I could type them (last I checked, my wpm was around 50-60). Minimal mistakes were made and that\'s solely because I didn\'t have a chair to sit on. Only one final test remained - gaming. Seeing as microcenter didn\'t have any available games (or chairs for that matter), I decided to pull the trigger.3 days later my keyboard came in and once again it didn\'t disappoint.  This keyboard, personally for me, is built as close to perfection as possible. Hitting the keys are now so incredibly satisfying now and they feel incredible. I love everything about the keyboard. It\'s great for long term typing and gaming - going on 5 hours now no problem. It\'s visually pleasing to look at, even without the RGB lights but the lights do make it even more of a pleasure to look at. I didn\'t fool around with the lights too much yet but there is a program (Swarm) that lets you customize the light patterns  as well as setup multiple profiles and macros. The keyboard also comes with a magnetic wrist rest and braided cable to let you know it\'s of high quality design. Most importantly, the $120 price tag is extremely reasonable for a keyboard of this quality (I believe it\'s $150 at microcenter).  Most of its best selling competitors are $150 and up and they don\'t even look half as good. The K70 low profile starts at $160 as well as the Razer Huntsman Elite. I\'m a huge fan of the DeathAdder (my current mouse) but Razer Huntmans Elite keyboard clicks were EXTREMELY audible and I hear their build quality has fallen off in the past few years. Roccat is a German manufacturer so when they advertise that they take pride in their builds, I can believe it.I haven\'t run into any cons yet, at least nothing noticeable. As for improvements to future models, I know Corsair includes a USB port on their keyboard as well as a giant X underneath the keyboard through which cables can be run and held in place - both of which this keyboard lacks. Not a complaint from my end as I have more USB ports on my rig than I know what to do with and the cable\'s length is long enough - around 5-6ft I believe. The final test for this keyboard is the reliability test. I\'m hoping it lasts for at least 3 years. I will report back if I run into any issues with soft or hardware.Final verdict: 10/10 - I highly recommend it.','2021-12-20 08:59:44',5,5,200),(422,'  I bought this keyboard on 4/20/2020. It was great for a few months, then sometime in August, the \"a\" key and \"Left Shift\" key stopped being as responsive. As a gamer, I would mostly notice this in game when trying to strafe left or crouch/crouch move. I did all the steps the Amazon tech suggested, who then recommended to reach out to the manufacturer to ask for a replacement. The manufacturer gave me similar steps with a couple additional ones, which did not resolve the issue at all. The \"Left Shift\" key is extremely noticeable when typing now. The manufacturer did say it\'s likely a faulty switch, but neither them, nor Amazon is willing to respond to resolve the issue. DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS KEYBOARD.','2021-12-20 08:59:45',1,14,200),(423,'  I was in the market for a new \"daily driver\" all rounder keyboard and this one caught my eye. After reading the specs and actually watching a review on Youtube I decided to pull the trigger. I wanted to like this keyboard. Spending this much on a keyboard I wanted to like it very much... but from the time it arrived shipped in its own retail box (no outer box...  shame on you Amazon) I was disappointed. For this price they have set the bar rather high for themselves and unfortunately they missed the mark in almost every respect.The LEDs are blinding! The secondary functions on the key caps are barely visible unless you have the LEDs turned up all the way. At which point they become VERY distracting. When viewed from even the slightest of angles it becomes the first keyboard I feel I need to shield my eyes from...Bad switch. You can slowly press  a key down past the \" tactile bump\" a MEASURABLE  distance before the key stroke registers. This distance varies from key to key as does the severity of the tactile bump. The action feels rough and gritty. It is not pleasant nor is it comfortable to type on. I felt my fingers begin to fatigue just minutes into use.  There is very little key wobble but at the sacrifice of smooth action. In games the action was too stiff. I felt my movement to be hindered and was missing the easiest of shots.The software is what I have come to expect from these companies...Basic. Bare-bones. One of the biggest features missing is the ability to layer lighting effects.They key caps are ABS and have a nice almost velvety texture that will be lost to finger shine within the first day of use.  They are produced in house for this switch. Aftermarket key caps will not fit these switches.There is so much keyboard flex it feels like you can twist the thing into a pretzel. The aluminum top plate is very thin and seems to be there more for looks than actual rigidity.The wrist rest is not padded and is uncomfortable.The highest quality feature of this item is the volume control dial. Very definitive steps and felt well made.For this price there are FAR better options out there. This keyboard is over thought and under engineered. It is way over priced for what you are getting.','2021-12-20 08:59:46',1,12,200),(424,'  I bought this keyboard a month ago along with the roccat leadr mouse.  I\'ve had nothing but problems with both products.  The keyboard is beautiful and feels great and I would love to say I loved it.  But periodically the lights stop moving and the swarm software just hangs.  Talking to support has been slow and painful.  They have had me reinstall the software to no avail.  I\'ve adjusted to just living with this.  As long as I don\'t use the sofware or reboot my computer it seems to work fairly reliably.  Course after a reboot or if I use the control panel to change lighting settings on the keyboard there is a good chance it will hang.  Once it does there is no fix other than unplugging the keyboard and plugging it back in.  I really wish I could fix this as I like the keyboard quite a bit.  Now on to post about the leadr mouse.','2021-12-20 08:59:47',1,19,200),(425,'  UPDATED REVIEW:I\'ve had this keyboard exactly a week now and I am still very pleased with it. It\'s one of the best keyboards I\'ve ever used. It seems well made and like it should hold up for a number of years if you take care of it. I\'m very pleased.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I searched for a good mechanical keyboard for about 2 months. Originally I wanted a tenkeyless keyboard, and I actually purchased the Corsair K100 TKL, but it had silver speed switches on that were way too sensitive. It was great to game with though, but terrible for typing. I wished this keyboard had brown/tactile switches, but because it didn\'t I ended up sending it back. I type on a keyboard much more than I game with one. Then I got the Logitech G915 at a great price on eBay (nearly $100 off brand new). I thought I\'d be pleased with that keyboard, but it was a bigger disappointment than the Corsair K100 TKL. I don\'t recommend it. I looked at a few other keyboards, and even bought another one from Corsair (from their website) and cancelled it because it didn\'t ship in nearly three weeks.In all of my research, I had come across this one from time to time. The thing that kept me from buying it was that I thought the keys being raised were a gimmick and wouldn\'t be that easy to type with. Well, I was wrong. This keyboard is super easy to type with, and is one of the best keyboards I have ever used. Correction, IT IS the best keyboard I have ever used. Typing on this thing is effortless.I have the tactical version of this keyboard, which is similar to brown switches. The RGB lighting is great on it right out of the box, and that\'s why I used (the default). The look of this keyboard is very sleek with black brushed aluminum, and doesn\'t feel cheap at all. Aside from typing, that\'s another thing I love about it. It looks cool on my desk. And the slim form factor is right up my alley. Coming from a Corsair K55 full sized keyboard, I didn\'t want another big and bulky board. But this one is perfect - even with the palm rest. When it comes to typing, the sound is not loud at all. It\'s a very satisfying tactile sound, that most probably won\'t pick up on if you\'re in a Zoom / Teams / web meeting. either. The keys sound great when typing. The volume knob is simple to use, and instead of twisting it, I usually just place my hand to the side of it and scroll it backward or forward. It has a tactile feel as well, and is easy to control. I haven\'t had a chance to game with it, so I can\'t speak on that, but it seems like it should be no problem. I could go on and on, but I don\'t want to be longwinded. Other people have left great reviews, and they were right.Lastly, I was able to catch this keyboard on sale for $109.99, which was $50 off the regular price. I probably would\'ve bought it anyway, but still - I\'m happy about that. I recommend it.','2021-12-20 08:59:48',5,20,200),(426,'  Brown switches are great for typing.  Terrible for gaming.  I was hoping the 0.2mm reduction in actuation and travel was going to be the difference maker - it wasn\'t.  Mechanical switches that aren\'t \"speed\" are absolutely bad for gaming.  Just don\'t.This keyboard killed my joy for gaming so much when I was trying to adjust,  so much that I ended up not playing anything because I hated the feel of my favorite games.  The key press and actuation are still way too long for gaming.  While this is better than the Philips that I tried, it\'s still way too much over priced and over hyped for what it achieves.I only considered it namely because it had more of the features that I wanted in  keyboard than others, but the volume knob is terribly placed and implemented that it may as well be missing.  A stiff volume knob is fine, but when it requires a thumb and forefinger to use, having it so close to the upper keys will interfere, and that makes it more of  hassle to use than it\'s worth.  Also, requiring software installed in order to change ANYTHING about the RGB is a no-no.While I got it on sale, I can\'t even recommend it at the sale price.While I like brown switches for typing, the tactile response seems diminished with this iteration, and the travel is still too long.  So much so, that I am considering permanently returning to mecha-membrane or the like switches, because mechanical is in the sorriest state right now.  The \"fastest\" switches are without tactile feedback, which I enjoy, and ruins my enjoyment.','2021-12-20 08:59:49',2,18,200),(427,'  This keyboard is amazing but not for the clumsy. If you\'ve spilled a drink on your keyboard more than 3 times in your life I may say avoid it as it takes days to unstick your keys and you can\'t remove them, just the caps. Stay for tips on how to clean this thing. Overall this thing is sleek, solid, and sexy. I have the cherry red keys but would have loved to have tried the brown. It was important for me to have a quiet, wireless keyboard so having a corded mechanical keyboard wasn\'t even on my mind. After a few videos learning about mechanical keyboards I decided to give this one a go, was pleasantly surprised plus the braided cord on this is stylish. It\'s quieter than my last Logitech keyboard, more responsive, lower profile with all of the functionality, but not as comfortable as the hand rest they provide (detachable) is just hard plastic. This was 100% a style decision because it looks good but feels like crap. Roccat should definitely create a comfortable attachable wrist rest and give a discount to those who purchased this with the hard plastic one. Like me. Let\'s talk about how to clean this thing if you have any accidents. Please note, I\'m not responsible for your messing up your own keyboard, nor is the company. This has worked for me.Cleaning:If you are clumsy enough to have spilled a sticky drink over your ballin new keyboard the way to get it back in order is to use rubbing alcohol with some q-tips. Unplug your keyboard. Remove the black cap of the sticky keys affected, dip the q-tip in some rubbing, stronger the better, and press the wet q-tip into the exposed sticky key. It\'s fine if the clear capsule gets a bunch of rubbing alcohol in it. Constantly press the keys as quickly as you can to spread the rubbing alcohol and clean away whatever drink got there in the first place. Do about 3 times a day. As you press on the keys you\'ll notice it feels normal however the stickiness will return after it sets for awhile. You have to this for about 4 days for everything to be back to normal, you will notice it getting progressively better.Quick review:-The lighting effects are great i just wish the ripple effect was able to remain backlit with a solid color while in use. It\'s the greatest preset but hard to use in the dark. No, the wave effect isn\'t the same.-I\'ve seen people talking about the edge of the keys being sharp on youtube, wth are they doing with this keyboard? Just type on it. lol- The knob can use some more graphics, even just lines. It\'s a feature but it\'s bland on your keyboard. Maybe it\'ll help if it were metal-  I\'m glad they didn\'t use the traditional cherry keys. Roccat Keys are lit, literally. The height of the clear portion makes the keys hover which is classy. Everyone should follow this model. I think the roccat team can go above and beyond and make these module and dominate the field.- Now that I know how to clean this thing, I love it. Guys, get rid of the two screws above the F1 and F4 keys, I just noticed them while writing the review.- I\'m not using this keyboard as a gamer, I\'m a designer. I have little need to use the game mode but the software should let you change the function of the keys for various software and detect that software like my logi mx master mouse does.That\'s it guys. TLDR. The keyboard is good. If you aren\'t someone who cares about style and you don\'t care about lights, but you care about silence, you can go for a switch-key. I like this one though, I\'d buy again. Your friends will notice this keyboard when they visit.','2021-12-20 08:59:50',4,6,200),(428,'  If Captain Ahab had used this keyboard when hunting Moby Dick, he would have easily killed the beast. This thing blows my old Razer keyboard out of the water in every single category. It appears very well made, with no visible scratches or dents in it. Although this is more of a personal preference, the keys feel perfect to me. The rgb lights are excellent and are much more vibrant than what I\'ve seen on other keyboards. The software for this keyboard is easy to install and use. I am 90% convinced that God Himself created this keyboard.HOWEVERI had more trouble with this packaging than I did with my last girlfriend. Heck, when the package arrived, I wasn\'t sure if it was even a keyboard. The box could have fit a small child inside of it, and looked like it had been attacked by a rabid raccoon. The tape was the real shiner, though. Trying to tear this tape open is like trying to split an atom.Great keyboard though!','2021-12-20 08:59:51',5,20,201),(429,'  I bought the 200$ Apex Pro from SteelSeries to replace my Logitech G910 and liked it so much I wanted to use it at work (I\'m that guy at the office who uses a gaming keyboard for work, but I\'m a programmer so people expect it). I didn\'t want to move it around and couldn\'t justify buying two, so I got this as a middle ground because it\'s basically a cheaper version of that one, the only difference between the Apex 5 and Pro is that the 5 uses a plastic frame, doesn\'t have an extra USB outlet and it doesn\'t have the Apex Pro mechanical switches that let you control the actuation point of each individual key.However, Regardless of the more expansive features of the Apex Pro, I discovered that I liked typing on the Apex 5 more, even if it is cheaper. The clicky feeling of the mechanical like switches are simply too satisfying for their own good and I honestly miss them when using the other keyboard that\'s twice the price for typing.Now, one thing I\'ll concede on is I haven\'t tried them for gaming, and I really like the Apex Pro for gaming because I can make certain keys more sensitive - this one doesn\'t have that feature - but I can\'t imagine it would be bad if that\'s what you\'re looking for. It\'s also a lot louder than the Apex Pro, but when I brought that up with one of my co-workers who sits next to me, they said they didn\'t even notice it.Steel Series makes excellent products in general, so I highly recommend you give this keyboard a shot. Don\'t let the fact that it\'s not technically \"mechanical\" bother you, it still feels amazing.','2021-12-20 08:59:52',5,11,201),(430,'  The material of this keyboard is simply top-notch. Video reviews you\'ve seen about this keyboard are accurate: it\'s very high quality for a very low price (compared to others on the market). The keys are made of a smooth, matte plastic with a non-slip surface. The keys are satisfyingly clicky and soft (Blue hybrid keys).However, my largest gripe with his keyboard is the actuation pressure. Simply tapping a key with your finger can cause it to be pressed, they\'re hair-trigger keys. Very, very little pressure is required, and the key input is registered BEFORE the key is pressed completely down (about halfway). This isn\'t something I like whatsoever, however, it\'s not a deal breaker. I still recommend this keyboard, but this \"issue\' is something to be aware of.','2021-12-20 08:59:53',3,4,201),(431,'  I had my eye on the Apex 7 Pro for a while, but as someone who isn\'t a PC gamer, I couldn\'t justify the purchase. My only real reason for wanting it was I thought it looked cool and just wanted it bad. So it kind just sat in my wishlist. Then I happened across this the Apex 5, and I was shocked at the price and the fact it had almost every feature that made me like the Apex 7.I saw people complain about the blue switches and that they are loud, which they are, but I LOVE the clicky noises, very satisfying. It doesn\'t have USB passthrough, but that is all right, not a significant loss. I recommend 100% recommend this keyboard for anyone who wants premium without the price tag.','2021-12-20 08:59:54',4,15,201),(432,'            Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n        \n\n\n   Let me just start off by saying that I am not a gamer, so I can\'t really provide the most in-depth review of it. But, so far, this has ranked in the top three keyboards I\'ve owned for value, if not the best. The hybrid blue switches are pure tactility and a pleasure to type on, albeit slightly less resistant than a normal full mechanical MX blue. The ABS keycaps have a premium matte black finish, making it feel even better, and the wristrest is perfect. Not the mushy kind like razer\'s, actually a bit hard, but that is all accounted for by the rubber on top, which provides lots of support while typing. the video above is comparing this keyboard against an apple magic keyboard. Which is better is your opinion, but I think the Apex wins. At a slightly beefy price of $99.99, I expected to be blown awayy, and, suffice to say, I wasn\'t disappointed.','2021-12-20 08:59:55',5,6,201),(433,'  The Apex 5 Hybrid keyboard is an amazing choice for those looking to put together a decent gaming setup or a much needed needed upgrade from a cheaper membrane keyboard. While this is NOT a mechanical keyboard, the tactile feel and responsiveness of the keys is incredible and will definitely give you that mechanical feel without shelling out the extra $50-$100 or more to get an actual mechanical keyboard.The Apex 5 also has very nice rgb lighting, with multiple presets and tons of options to make your keyboard glow in any way you please (or not glow at all, if that\'s your thing). There\'s also a multimedia button, a volume wheel and a tiny LCD display that can display images, gifs and can even be used to monitor the status of your hardware in real time, plus much more.Finally,  this keyboard is a dream to type and game with. All of the keys are on an angle, which feels so natural to rests your fingers on. It also comes with a pretty sturdy set of feet to raise the keyboard, and it feels wonderful in combination with the detachable wristbar. Even as someone who is less experienced with pc gaming I have no issue reaching any of the keys without comfort while playing games (That\'s a pretty big deal for me, since on most average keyboards the ctrl button is just a bit too far away and is uncomfortable to press, especially in first person games where crouch is assigned to it)Overall, the Apex 5 is a great keyboard and delivers on everything it promises. At it\'s current price there really isn\'t much other keyboards that can compete with this one. If you\'re looking to do some serious gaming and want a good all around keyboard that will be up to the task, the Apex 5 has you covered.','2021-12-20 08:59:56',5,15,201),(434,'  I really like the look of this keyboard AND the way it feels when typing. I had a gaming keyboard with Cherry Red MX switches and it was great for gaming, but terrible for typing. I\'d always ended up with tons of typos because of the key sensitivity.This keyboard is a great for both gaming and typing. It\'s a little loud and clicky, which doesn\'t really bother me. The LCD lights are extremely bright and attractive.My biggest gripe with the keyboard is that the built in OLED screen is almost completely useless. It\'s so hidden behind the tall 10-key keys that I went a full three days of owning it, before I noticed that it was there. You need to really lean forward over your keyboard to see it. This is not a big deal because I didn\'t buy it for that tiny screen. If an on keyboard OLED screen important to you, buy a different keyboard.I definitely recommend this keyboard to anyone who games, but also wants to type things without constant typos.','2021-12-20 08:59:57',5,15,201),(435,'  I love SteelSeries. I have their Artis Pro Headset and wanted to pair together with the keyboard. As it currently stands the spacing between the keys or the way the keys face is planed seems to through me off. It doesnt feel natural for me to use this keyboard, which is really disappointing. I\'m going to give it another week to see if I can adapt to this but I had just ordered two new keyboards and the first one, offbrand, felt much easier to use. Just a heads up for fellow gamers, maybe test this one out before you commit to it. Overall quality, etc is there but the ergonomics of the keyboard seem to off put me','2021-12-20 08:59:58',3,11,201),(436,'  There are many good things about this keyboard but overall, I don\'t recommend this keyboard and I will explain why.First some positive points:+Appearance; This keyboard simply looks amazing. With light on or off it just looks so minimal and beautiful. The RBG colors are probably one of the best I have ever seen.+Media keys: they volume wheel and the pause/play button are really helpful.+The wrist rest: This is my favorite thing about this keyboard.  Some Youtube reviewers say it feels cheap but I just love it. It could be slightly wider to support larger hands but it’s just great. So easy to clean and not too rough and not to soft like razer wrist rests.+Cable routing options: it really helps to keep your cable out of the way and keep you desk organized.+Build quality: The keyboard feels solid and really sturdy on your desk. It also doesn’t move or slip. The wrist rest doesn’t move either.+The font/legends: they are standard and aren’t weird looking.+Steel series engine is really amazing. So easy to use and really helpful+You can change RGB effects and macro functions without having to use the software which is really convenient.Now, let’s take a look at some negatives:-the keycaps: The keycaps feel really really cheap. Even after only 3 weeks of use, I feel the surface of the keys that I use feel washed out and a bit smoother than the first day. They also have a quality to them that makes them extra noisy and rattly.-the switches: I have so many problems with the switches. First of all, why blue switches? Almost no gamer prefers blue switches for gaming and this keyboard is advertised and designed for gamers. So this is the first really weird choice. Honestly, I feel they decided to use blue switches because they are targeting younger generation who are probably buying a mechanical keyboard for the first time so they wanted to give them something that feels and sounds a lot different than a membrane or a laptop keyboard but I simply hate these switches. They are loud in the most annoying way. I have heard other blue switches and some of the have a sophisticated quality to them but these simply sound horrible.Anther extremely negative aspect of this keyboard is that it uses “Hybrid” switches. (you can see on youtube what they are) This is bad because of two reasons. First of all, with the same price or even cheaper, you can get fully mechanical keyboards that feel and sound 100 times better. Also, if one of your switches breaks (like mine did) there is no way you can find a replacement for them. I contacted Steelseries and they simply said they don’t sell the switches separately. One of the main reasons why people buy mechanical keyboards is to be able to replace dead or broken switches which is impossible with Apex 5. I ended up asking for a replacement, but the second keyboard was defective as well (the space bar got stuck in place). Luckily, amazon had my back and refunded almost all my money. One last problem I have with the switches is that they don’t feel reliable. Although they are blue (clicky and tactile), the switches sometimes actuate before the click which automatically cancels the whole point of the keyboard being tactile. :DThe switches are produced by a Chinese company called TTC. I have never heard their name so it’s easy to put the blame on them but it is a Steel series product after all.-The OLED: It looks cool but it’s just useless. It does all the thing they claim is does but I’m not the kind of person to put the time to get used to it. I simply prefer 3 simple LED light for Caps, numlock and scroll lock.What annoys me the most about this keyboard in general is that it doesn’t hold up to older Steelseries products quality. To me, it is clear that Steel series is targeting the less experienced consumers and not professional gamers anymore. I mean, there is no way a pro gamer puts up with this quality. It is just unacceptable from Steel Sereis. I have a Steel series mouse and I’ll probably buy another Steel series mouse after this one. But I’m sure I won’t buy their keyboards at least for a long time.All in all, this is simply a bad keyboard for this price. Yes, it has many cool features but there are so many better keyboards that you can find so almost half the price. Honestly, after some research on the internet, I am convinced that gaming brand keyboards are not worth it because they are almost always over-priced.','2021-12-20 08:59:59',3,15,201),(437,'  I think a big issue with what people say about hybrid-mechanical keyboards is that people who are already used to mechanical keyboards don\'t really want to move away from the mechanical feature anyway, so of course you\'ll hear a lot of bad things about hybrid-mechanical setups. In this case, I\'ve only been incredible happy with this keyboard.The RGB is great and is incredibly customizable, and has 5 onboard memory profiles. The keyboard is very well made, and I\'ve honestly been quite impressed with it. The typing experience is great too. There is a point where you feel a gentle \'click\' on your fingers, and that click is very well timed to when the keyboard actually registers a button press. So, even though this keyboard isn\'t mechanical, it still gives you that fast-clicky feeling if that\'s what you\'re into. I would, however say, that the only reason to get a hybrid-mechanical keyboard is price.I think if you are really trying to get a deal, the apex pro 5 is a great option. I got it for about $70, compared to other keyboards at about $130 with similar functionality. If you\'re already considering that $100-150 price range, then go full mechanical. You\'ll probably be getting a little more in terms of functionality and you\'ll also be getting the full mechanical experience. Overall I\'m very happy with this keyboard.','2021-12-20 08:59:50',4,13,201),(438,'            Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n        \n\n\n   For some background, while I do use the keyboard for some gaming (mostly FPS) I am primarily a typist that transcribes hours upon hours of audio for work. I\'ve owned the original in blue switches, red LED for some time, but wanted an upgrade to quieter switches to hear audio better and get some nice rgb.It seems that both Cherry and Corsair have tried to cut corners in places that are less likely to be immediately noticed by customers. This will still very much yield a lesser quality, and more likely to fail over time product.-Compared to the original K70, the overall quality of this product is less. The first and most glaring thing I noticed are the stabilizers for larger keys (space, 0, shift, etc) are far looser/poorly fit on the mk2. The black retention pieces (see video) have SO much slop compared to the original. I can only really get any movement on the original if I really force it. This creates not just extra movement on the keys, but it also makes it noisey. Often times, this is part of what gives people that notorious spacebar rattle. As pieces wear over time this will only get worse. Especially for a transcriber, I have several special functions that rely on shift and combinations of shift with other keys. The extra slop is noticeable compared to the first version and I can hear it almost as loud as blue switches through headphones when transcribing audio. Already I have an awful amount of audible rattle on my backspace key, while my original is rock solid.-A second thing I\'ve noticed is how they\'ve relaxed the tolerances on the key caps and switch stems is. On the original version, it was very difficult to remove the key caps from the switches unless you had a wire puller. On the \"updated\" mk2, they pop off so easily and can be put back on with so little finger pressure, I almost didn\'t believe I had them on. This is not a good thing: it will make the caps more susceptible to wear that will create more slop, and overall just does not convey quality. If you\'ve ever had a spacebar that had a problem where overtime if you hit one side of the key and the other side would pop up and stay there, this is why: keycaps/stems with poor tolerances.-Third, the switches themselves have more play in them than the original k70. It created a noticeable amount more key wobble.Overall, after a year and hundreds upon hundreds of hard typing and key smashing when raging, my original k70 is still a higher quality product than the new mk2. The tighter tolerances on the original almost make it feel like a newer product than the mk2 I got in the mail literally today. The overall typing experience on the mk2 is just sloppier and it does not inspire confidence in the long run. Some upgrades are admittedly awesome. The clear switches really enhance the lighting, the on-board profile storage is fantastic. HOWEVER, looking at it in terms of the functionality this piece of hardware is required/designed to perform, (TYPING) they clearly decided to throw away some quality in favor of some pretty bells and whistles. If I had never experienced another high end keyboard, specifically the predecessor, I may have given this a higher rating, but in lieu of knowing what\'s being lost, I can\'t.At some level, it\'s almost insulting that they\'re trying to pass this off as an \"upgrade\" when they\'ve reduced the essential functions of their original to something of lesser quality.','2021-12-20 08:59:11',2,4,203),(439,'  Disclaimer: Ive used the Steel Series 6Gv2 (Cherry MX Black), as well as the Razer Black widow (Cherry MX Brown).For purposes of this review i am focusing on the performance, feel and build quality. (Spoiler: ITS FANTASTIC)Of all the keyboards i have used and typed on, this is by far the greatest thing my fingers have ever had the pleasure of experiencing besides *censored for family-friendly purposes*.Let me just say that if you enjoy linear switches, but are nervous about the sensitivity of the Cherry-Silver switches found on this board then fear not, for that was also my fear. The problem i had with cherry black was that sometimes i would press a key quickly just to find that i did not press hard enough and i would actually miss key presses that way. I got the black widow for the brown switches thinking that the tactile bump would help me know when the key was actuated. While it helped i could not help but feel that the tactile bump somehow slowed me down or got in the way of that smooth gliding typing feel.ENTER THE MX CHERRY SILVER.While i have never tried reds, i have heard that they are some of the most preferred switches for gaming. Having tried these silver switches i can now see why. (Reds are similar to silver switches, but with a deeper actuation point of 2.0mm compared to the Silver\'s 1.2mm actuation travel. The Reds total travel distance is also deeper at 4.0mm, Silver\'s total key travel is 3.4mm deep) When i go for a key, there is no worry about the key not actuating for the key effortlessly gives into the force of my finger. The switches are not so sensitive where the weight of my finger alone actuates them. It is just PERFECT. It truly is a hard thing to describe. For gaming i cannot imagine a better switch or board. And typists fear not for if you are sure footed in your typing skills then know that the linear switch is not your enemy when it comes to the Silver MX switches. I actually look forward to using this Keyboard every day. That is literally how much i enjoy this board. This is the first review i\'ve wrote on amazon in years. That is literally how much i enjoy typing on this board. I almost dont want to even stop typing now lol. The funny thing is i was going to get the k70 with cherry mx browns, but decided on the LIMITED EDITION WHITE VERSION because it includes the DOUBLE SHOT KEYCAPS. which was a big deal for me. I wanted the most durable keyboard i could get and i saw how on the regular k70 some people complained about breaking keycaps. (YOU CAN BUY THE DOUBLE SHOT KEYCAPS SEPARATELY FOR $50). I thought it was well worth the risk with Amazons generous return policy to try this one out. PLUS THAT WHITE KEYBOARD IS SEXY LOOKING AF.I typed this whole review out on the board and only made 1-2 typos.rgb lighting is self explanatory. its gorgeous. everything about this board is gorgeous.BOTTOM LINE OR TLDR:Avid typist or Gamer you will not regret splurging on this board. It is the best purchase i have ever made for a PC peripheral and it works well on MAC as well. The included wrist rest is also really nice. though it is rigid is has a soft touch texture and has eliminated elbow and wrist discomfort that i would normally get on my glass desk surface.ps. DID I MENTION HOW MUCH I LOVE THE VOLUME WHEEL? EVEN WORKS ON THE MAC!Edit(11/3/2021) This keyboard is still rocking without a single issue yet! I hope they continue producing it. It seems the newer designs are straying away from what worked so well on this edition. Many of these companies are attempting to produce their own gamer switches rather than rely on MX Cherry. MX Cherry has the best reputation for switch quality though for obvious reasons so keep that in mind when researching your next keyboard.','2021-12-20 08:59:00',5,18,203),(440,'  It worked exactly as advertised. However I must point out it struggles like all corsair products, if it is not connected to the PC and connected to any form of USB hub. To include monitor, external, or internal. Corsair products do horrible with hubs and should be connected only to the back USB slots of your PC. Even front side struggles unless it is a USB 3.0 --Don\'t ask me why. I have purchased over a dozen of their products over the years, and it is always the same issue. However just on a lark I decided to test it anyway. Sure enough it would give me yellow or red ! points in corsair link on reboot in any USB hub on my old and my new gaming pc. Monitor USB, Separate USB hub, didn\'t matter. So the issue persists.The product is great really no need for details other reviewers covered that. I just wanted to point out an issue that most have no idea is the cause of 99% of negative reviews. That for most people won\'t be an issue at all.If you think you can go razor and avoid this issue... you can\'t their keyboards have the same problem. Logitech keyboards however do not, at least the prodigy doesn\'t. I haven\'t used nearly as many of their products as corsair or razor so I can\'t speak for the majority.','2021-12-20 08:59:54',5,2,203),(441,'  If you go on r/MechanicalKeyboards you\'ll see corsair keyboards getting a lot of flack for being overpriced for for their quality but honestly I don\'t really see it, I think the quality is good enough, it\'s no tank but for something that will just sit on your desk the whole time it really doesn\'t need to be. The mk.2 seems to be sturdy enough, the top is a fairly thick piece of aluminum, about as thick as I would expect a keyboard faceplate to be at least, and the whole thing is fairly ridged overall. The bottom of made of plastic and I see people complain that it\'s too thin but if you\'re not using your keyboard to bludgeon your enemies then it should hold up just finr. My biggest gripe with this keyboard are the keycaps, they\'re light, thin and laser ablated so they\'re likely to wear over time. Corsair offers a doubleshot version of these same keycaps, but they\'re another $50 so if you\'re set on getting those then this starts to become a nearly $200 keyboard. That being said, I think that if quality had to be sacrificed somewhere to meet this price point then the keycaps are the most logical option as they\'re the only part of the keyboard you can easily modify yourself if you want and I really don\'t see them as a huge problem until they actually start to wear. This keyboard comes with another set of WASD and QERF keys with a textured surface that won\'t wear so if you mostly use those it\'s probably not a huge issue. I suppose only time will tell how bad these keys wear.I was looking for several things in a keyboard, I wanted an aluminum top plate, a minimal, clean look, RGB and I wanted it to be mechanical and this keyboard meets all those things.I really like the brushed aluminum, it doesn\'t take on finger prints, it looks really good and it adds some good heft so full points there. The switches protrude out of the faceplate so there is nowhere for dirt and dust to fall in to and get trapped, this makes it really easy to clean with one of those compressed air cans so if you like to keep things clean then that is a huge plus. This is a really good looking keyboard, it doesn\'t overdo it by trying to look all gamery and wouldn\'t look out of place in an office or anything (with the RGB off at least), though you can see the pictures for yourself so whether you like how it looks is really up to you.The RGB is fully customizable on a per key basis but if you want all the fancy effects then you always need to have the corsair iCUE software running in the background which I\'m not a huge fan of. You can save three RGB profiles onto the keyboards internal memory but the effects are a bit more limited if you chose to rely only on that. You can still set each key to any color you want and you can use some effects, but the effects can\'t be as elaborate as if you have the software running in the background. This isn\'t a huge problem for me because I don\'t really want much more than static back lighting anyway but its something you should be aware of. I guess each key can be readdressed to do whatever you want and you can make macros, but this particular model doesn\'t have any dedicated macro keys. These aren\'t really features that I\'ve needed to use and so I don\'t particularly care about them.I got the version with the cherry mx brown switches because up to now I\'ve been using a keyboard with blue clones and I wanted to try something different. I miss the clickyness of the blues but I like the feel of the browns well enough, I only wish that they were more tactile because the tactile bump isn\'t super prominent and isn\'t very sharp.  The browns are a lot less noisy that blues but they\'re still nowhere near silent. Most of the sound just comes from the keys bottoming out so it could be made just a little more silent with some o-rings but I don\'t like the feel of the o-rings as much. I considered returning this key board and getting the version with the blue switches for a little while but I\'ve grown to like the brown switches, but it\'s all subjective. A lot of hard core mech keyboard enthusiasts don\'t really like browns but I don\'t have much experience with other switches so I can\'t say too much about that.The dedicated media controls are nice to have I suppose, but I only ever find myself using the volume knob. The wrist rest is just solid plastic but it has a soft texture and is definitely a plus, I haven\'t used one up to now but I don\'t think I could go without one in the future as it makes typing so much more comfortable. The USB passthrough is a nice feature, I use it for my wireless mouse dongle so that it\'s closer and the connection is more reliable but I imagine that it would be really convenient for a wired mouse as well, there are some routing channels on the bottom of the keyboard for the wire to keep things tidy if you do use a wired mouse . I don\'t think the passthrough wouldn\'t be ideal for something that you would remove and insert frequently because it\'s on the back of the keyboard which makes it awkward to get to in my opinion. The USB cable is braided and really thick which gives it a pretty premium feel. It\'s also super long so you shouldn\'t have much trouble getting it to where you need it to go. It\'s pretty ridged so if you move the keyboard around a lot on your desk that might be a bit of a problem.This keyboard really needs to be packaged better, Amazon just ships it in the box that the keyboard comes in and there isn\'t any foam or anything in that box so the only thing between the top of the keyboard and the boxes that will inevitably be dropped or stacked on top of it during shipping is a piece of cardboard. Because of this, my keyboard came with some of the keys knocked out both times, I replaced my first one because I thought it came broken. The first one\'s volume wheel was really loose compared to the second one I received, I don\'t know if that was a manufacturing defect or from rough treatment during shipping but it would be nice if Amazon just shipped it in another box with some proper packing material.','2021-12-19 23:16:00',5,2,203),(442,'  I purchased the CORSAIR K70 RGB MK.2 SE Mechanical RAPIDFIRE and have been using it for over 3 months now. If you\'re questioning about getting this or not, not to get all Shia Labeouf on you but...JUST! DO! IT! Corsair\'s listing photos are an accurate representation of the actual product. Also, it\'s currently cheaper ($130 what a steal) than when I had bought it ($174). At first, I was hesitant because of the price, but in the end I bit the bullet and I\'m glad I did because I absolutely love everything about this keyboard.The white keys against a brushed aluminium frame is aesthetically pleasing. The special edition also looks great with custom keycaps. Also, the keys look as amazing as they feel. Like most mechanical keyboards, the keys feel and sound great to press. I\'ve been having a great time gaming with this keyboard because of its responsiveness and textured preset keycaps. At first, I was wary that the keys were white because they\'d get dirty easily, but that\'s actually not the case. Everything looks clean and new. Even the braided cord looks great.The RGB customization for Corsair is great. I love how easy it is to operate iCue. In addition, changing color profiles has been made easier with the addition of the first silver button on the left of the keyboard that looks like the silhouette of an orange-ish/yellow person. You can alternate between your saved RGB profiles by pressing that button. Next to that button is a little sun symbol which allows you to choose between 3 settings of lighting, which range between dim and bright. The music buttons above the number pad look great and I especially love the scroll wheel for volume, it\'s efficient and looks good.I actually do like the angled wrist rest. I didn\'t think I would be using it after reading about how others didn\'t like it in their review, but it\'s a lot more comfortable than I anticipated. While it doesn\'t feel like a pillow, I think it\'s great for gaming because of the elevation and the texture alleviates any kind of friction you\'d normally get leaning your wrist against the edge of your desk. I also appreciate the built-in USB port, it\'s great for anyone who doesn\'t have enough USB ports on their laptop/PC tower.I could go on and on about how much I love this keyboard, but all in all, it\'s a good looking keyboard that\'s efficient and definitely well-made with good quality materials. Worth it.','2021-12-19 23:16:01',5,16,203),(443,'  This is for the MK.2 SE. It\'s gorgeous. The (silver) aluminum surface partially reflects the RGB lighting underneath the key caps. The Corsair software (iCUE) allows for separate profiles that the user can switch between via a dedicated button on the keyboard.The Cherry MX Speed (silver) switches are nicer than the Cherry Silent (red/pink) switches I used previously (keyboard switches are, of course, personal preference).The PBT key caps are sturdy and well built. Additionally, it is nice to have an option to use textured WASD key caps, which come included. A key cap pull tool is also included.The media buttons and volume control work well. The volume dial is easy to rotate and very responsive. The back lighting for the media buttons are also RGB, so they can be set up to blend in or stand out.','2021-12-19 23:16:02',5,20,203),(444,'  I\'d like to issue a warning to all prospective buyers. Don\'t. Period. This keyboard is nothing but a marketing fiasco designed to make you think you are getting some sort of edge over the competition. I assure you, you are not.The marketing wants you to believe the extremely short actuation is a benefit, but it\'s nothing but a detriment. Keys on this keyboard activate like a hair trigger, even if slightly (and I mean SLIGHTLY) nudged. I can run my fingertips over it gently and it will create word spaghetti. This is insane, and all it does is cause you to take actions that you did not intend while playing.In addition, the Corsair iCUE software is joke. It takes up gigs of memory all to do what? Change the color? It makes zero sense. It\'s also excessively confusing and very very buggy. There is no reason a software like this should be so bloated.Stay away from this product, and probably Corsair all together. They are overpriced junk!','2021-12-19 23:16:03',1,16,203),(445,'  Been using the Corsair K70 for about a month now and here are my thoughts:1.  The quality of the keyboard is absolutely top notch.  The solid metal construction, the wrist rest, the packaging, the RGB lighting.  All amazing.  I could easily see this keyboard lasting me the rest of my life.2.  I am not an expert on mechanical keys and frankly it had been so long since I had used one I didn\'t really even care. I almost saved the money and just bought Corsair\'s regular keyboard (non mechanical).  However, after a month of using this I am glad I didn\'t.  It actually took me some time to get used to the mechanical switches but now that I am, I love them.  They make everything more enjoyable (typing and gaming) and certainly allow me to type faster.  There is no doubt about it, they are superior.3.  The roller in the upper right hand corner of this keyboard is main volume control, as you probably guessed.  Let me tell you:  its freakin awesome, just brilliant.  I use it constantly.  I don\'t think I can ever go back to having volume keys/ buttons.4.  This keyboard includes two additional sets of \"gaming\" keys.  Basically the A,S,D,Q,W and E keys but they are shaped differently and have a different texture so you can locate them more easily during gaming.  I am not using them but it is a nice touch by Corsair.  Someday I might throw them on just to try them.5.  Now the RGB: I have to say it is growing on me.  I did not buy this for the RGB and even now I still have it set on just a solid red glow, which is what its been on since I got it.  But I have also played Far Cry 5 and now the new Far Cry (New Dawn) with it and the native support in those two games is pretty awesome.  Particularly New Dawn.  The profile for that game is very nice and actually does add a level of interaction that you wouldn\'t expect.  I have only played New Dawn for a total of about an hour so far and have already seen this keyboard do a bunch of cool stuff in game.  For example, when you beat a mission, you get something like fireworks on the keyboard.  When it is night in the game, the keyboard RGB is more subdued.  The list goes on, the RBG lighting changes depending on what is happening in game and it really is cool, even to me.  I also have a Corsair Pro series water cooler and gaming mouse but the RBG lighting on those just isn\'t nearly as intricate as this keyboard.  I am now considering downloading some more profiles , or perhaps making one myself.Don\'t hesitate to buy this keyboard, you won\'t be disappointed with any aspect of it.  And certainly if you are an RGB fan, you are sure to love it.','2021-12-19 23:16:04',5,16,203),(446,'  It is a pretty solid keyboard quality wise. But i have been using it for a couple of days now and i plug my mouse to the keyboard and since both require so much electricity the performance of them suck. Mouse will literally be frozen for a second every two second and the keyboard would spam like 10 keys sometimes when you click one key.The iCue Corsair software is a complete menace, one of the worst software I have seen. It is not friendly user nor the interface leads you well, intuition and common sense can\'t be used to use this software. You have to guess and trouble shoot many times until you kind of get used to it but it\'s too complicated and wastes a lot of time. There is not logical buttons such as close tabs and stuff like that, you mostly have to click many areas of the screen to know where things are.  every piece of the screen of this software could either be clickable or not, but there isn\'t a concrete layout of tabs, mostly everything is thrown at users and the layers are all looking at you rather than one popping out per time. Very missleading.Incredibly hard-to-use software. Things are placed awkwardly. I also get a exclamation mark ontop of the keyboard icon sometimes but it provides no information about it so I don\'t know what is wrong.Impossible to know which tab, device or menu are you on since low-comon-sense Corsair made software terrible illogical. Basically you never get to know if something in its platform is clickable or not, where are you at since tabs or buttons don\'t show they are selected and everything is showned at the same time.Very difficult to understand. Keyboard did came with some minor damage which was not too visible on the side but that might be manufacture error','2021-12-19 23:16:05',1,2,203),(447,'  The keyboard arrived defective. After a few minutes of use I began having connection issues. It would disconnect and become unresponsive. The only solution was to disconnect the keyboard, wait a few minutes, then re-plug the keyboard. I noticed it would only work if I plugged in the lighting usb cable first, not the actual connection usb. I tried doing a soft reset, updating the keyboard software, updating my drivers, and even contacting Corsair support. Their support representatives were impatient, insisting they forward me to a customer support agent instead, who would later need to forward me BACK to the initial tech support agent (who was the only rep that could \"assist me with the issue\"). Additionally, the tech rep insisted I call Amazon if I had any persistent issues so they could forward me back to Corsair (Instead of just giving me a call back number).After creating an account with corsair support, having to provide non-relevant information (my address & phone number), i was Finally able to put in my support request via a ticket system. Afterwards the tech rep forwarded me instructions to hard reset the keyboard. Which was simply pressing the reset button under the keyboard and re-installing the keyboard software. Why not just tell me that over the phone instead of wasting my time and making me create an account (which funny enough had a low-key option to request for Corsair promotional emails - SPAM).The hard reset did NOT work, and I called amazon (as instructed by Corsair) to be forwarded back to Corsair Tech Support. Corsair proceeded to inform me they could not help me via phone (why not tell me that in the first place?). I proceeded to make progress to file my warranty claim. Their process is redundant, asking for both the invoice and receipt (asking for you to take a photo and forward it to them). They then ask you pull out your phone and take picture of the packaging in order to send them the serial number... why not just type the SN on a form via the website?All in all, the customer service was terrible, time consuming, and a waste of time. Save yourself the time if you encounter this issue, return it via Amazon (Hassle Free) and get your money back.','2021-12-19 23:16:06',1,18,203),(448,'  Top half of this review is an overall performance overview. Bottom half is an update about quality control and slow replacement issues that made me change this from a 4- to a 3-star review.I didn\'t purchase this keyboard for gaming, just straight typing. I work in transcription and have many of the same problems gamers do. I type faster when the keyboard gives me the right tactile feedback, it can\'t be too loud, the key spacing needs to be on-point, and even ghosting is a problem. The Ornata is one of the best keyboards I\'ve ever used and has noticeably increased my productivity.Key Feel: I\'m a heavy-handed typist, meaning membrane is generally easier for me to use. However, I love a good click. Having a \'tickity-tack\' sensation with depression helps me stay \'in the zone\' while I type. When I\'m not working, I type fastest on my Macbook Pro keyboard. Macbook keyboards are a sort of membrane/mechanical hybrid like the Ornata, which is the biggest reason I went with it. You get that \'click\' while still having gentler touch. The Ornata has a more aggressive \'click\' than a Macbook keyboard, but it\'s still that hybrid sensation.Key Height: The Ornata advertises itself as a mid-profile key on the Razer website (I don\'t know why all the professional reviews call it \'low profile\'; it definitely isn\'t even by gaming keyboard standards). I liked that idea. With low-profile keys (and especially full-on chiclets), it can be too easy to hit multiple keys at once when typing at max speed. However, the keys on the Ornata \'float\' above the profile of the keyboard base. The end effect definitely isn\'t as dramatic as high profile keys, but it\'s still on the higher side. I expected something shorter. Key height can play a big role in hand fatigue, especially if you\'re a heavy-handed typist. If they set the keys even a little bit into the base of the keyboard, or make them just a touch shorter, it would be closer to \'mid-profile.\' The trade-off you get for this key seating is easier cleaning (see Cleaning down below).Anti-Ghosting: When typing quickly, I often have a problem where I\'m hitting the next key in a sequence before my finger has fully \"disengaged\" the previous key. On every other keyboard I\'ve ever used, this means ghosting. I\'d get \'thes\' instead of \'these\' and so forth. The Ornata prevents that, and it significantly improves my work efficiency. I spend less time correcting the \'thes\' and \'tht\' and \'thoug\'s I normally have to deal with.Key Volume: I\'d rate this as a mid-volume key. It\'s much quieter 15-year-old, \'out of the box\' desktop mechanicals that pretty much go \"THUMPITY-WHACKITY,\" but it\'s nowhere near as quiet as my Macbook. I can still transcribe without the key volume making it hard to hear my files, but a friend of mine who works on the phone noted that their customers would absolutely be able to hear their typing. To me, the volume is too loud for a hybrid key. It seems like it\'s making an effort to make a sound. I think that\'s what bugs me the most about it. It\'s inorganic; it doesn\'t feel \'native\' to the key feel. If it was even the same volume but less sharp of a sound, it would be great. If you\'re looking for a \'stealthy\' keyboard, this definitely isn\'t it.Programability: TBA. I haven\'t messed with this yet, but I use a number of macros while I work. I\'ll update this review after I\'ve fiddled with it. The one thing I will say is that the keyboard updates are a mild annoyance. Your keyboard will stop working until you restart your computer, which I found out the hard way.As an aside, the Synapse software frequently leaves a lot to be desired. I\'m on the beta for the new version. It works better, but the \"upgraded\" main interface is enormous, slow loading, and ugly. Lots of negative space for no good reason. It also lacks the customization capabilities you would expect. Everything about the keyboard is customizable, but you can\'t customize the interface to only show the options you use. The Chroma (color-change) customization screen is still awkward to use, though it works much, much better than it used to.Color & Color Programming: Phenomenal. The color is just icing for me, but it makes my work day a lot more interesting. It\'s rich and lovely with a good color-to-color shift. There are a few problems with programming it. The first is that the software needs work, though the beta of the new Synapse works much better than the old one. I still have problems with the keyboard abruptly resetting the color cycle to default after updates.Cleaning: Someone asked a question about this and made me realize this keyboard is absurdly easy to clean. I have dogs that shed nonstop; fur tends to build up between keys in other keyboards. Because of the \'floating\' set and spacing of the keys, I don\'t get as much fur between the keys, and what does get in is a cinch to get out. I can tease pretty much anything that falls between the keys out with just a napkin or my nails. It would be effortless to clean up with canned air or just a paintbrush. Even if something was stuck to the membrane, you could dampen a Q-tip or a stiff paintbrush and get it right off.Overall, definitely recommend for heavy-handed typists that have a need for speed and accuracy. I knocked off a star for it overcompensating on the click loudness and the keys being taller than they should be for true \'mid-height.\'UPDATE, reduced from 4 to 3 stars:After having the keyboard for about eight months, the LEDs started glitching out. Razer customer service personnel is fantastic; I\'ve dealt with them twice now, and they\'re great. I sent my original keyboard back to Razer for a replacement. I appreciated free shipping both ways, but it was ground. It took almost a month between shipping it to them and getting my replacement.Six months after I received my replacement, the black coating is starting to wear off the center of my space bar. I have a .5 inch section where it\'s totally worn off an a 2 inch section where it has a heavy gloss from wearing down and is about to wear off. I had a shoddy laptop keyboard\'s coating last a good five years longer than this. The weird thing is that this didn\'t even happen on my last Ornata after six months of an equal amount of use.I contacted Razer customer service. I got prompt, professional replies, and the agent checked with a particular department about my issue. Unfortunately, this is considered normal \'wear and tear,\' and my warranty is considered to be from my original purchase date.Razer does offer replacement key caps, but they were out of stock when I contacted customer service.You\'d think a gaming keyboard would have key coatings tough enough to withstand heavy, rapid key press abuse. Just six months is pretty pathetic. This could be a quality control flub, but if so, the Ornata definitely has QC issues; this  marks the second time something has gone wrong with a brand new Ornata within less than a year.If this were a $30 keyboard, I wouldn\'t care so much. But you can\'t have a $100 MSRP on a keyboard and have quality issues like this, let alone replacement shipping that\'s as slow as it is.','2021-12-19 23:16:07',3,11,204),(449,'  Ok, it\'s a decent keyboard.  I\'m going to break down several elements.FUNTIONALITY: This is where I encountered issues.  Never in my life have I ever had to lubricate a keyboard, and certainly not one practically new out of the box.  I was breaking out the teflon spray on q-tip inside of 2 weeks.  Like, come on razer... it\'s a $90 keyboard and you\'re cutting corners on lube? The stuff they used was way too high viscosity and the keys would stick.  Works fantastically and smoother than new when you add a dab of teflon.RGB LIGHTING: VERY large selection of colors, just about any you can imagine you can select, and individual color coding is awesome for hotkeys across multiple games.SOFTWARE:  ATROCIOUS.  just plain BAD.  Fine for basic color coding and whatnot, but advanced lighting effects interfere with each other.  I tried stacking 2 wave effects in a relatively simple way, and it wouldn\'t adjust the speed for whichever was on the bottom layer, throwing off the sync.Other: the wrist rest is COMFY, but extremely delicate.  In a few weeks the faux leather coating has already begun to deteriorate.  However, I really like the cord management, there are 3 slots under the keyboard for you to direct the wire either left, right, or out the back.Conclusion: it\'s a decent keyboard, I like the tactile click despite the issues I\'ve had with lubrication, and not as loud as traditional mechanical switches.  That all being said, my next keyboard will be from Corsair.  I\'ve been a fan of Razer since they launched, and I\'ve watched the quality of their products slowly but surely deteriorate over time.  It\'s probably time for me to pick a new favorite gaming brand.','2021-12-19 23:16:08',3,14,204),(450,'  The Wrist-Rest is MAGNETIC!  I was a little upset when it didn\'t come attached to the keyboard; I thought it was going to slide around a bunch, then I found out it was magnetic when I nudged it up to the keyboard.This keyboard feels smooth. As the other reviews said, the keys make noise, but it isn\'t loud or obnoxious in any way.The click of the keys is actually a little satisfying to the touch when you press them.I\'ve never been disappointed with Razer.Let me tell you a short story of my experience and you will see why I\'m such a fan:I really like the gamepads (Razer Orbweaver Chroma).Well, I had one where the wrist-pad was sent with way too much sticky-paste, so much so that the rubber pad slowly slid off of the gamepad. It was annoying, and after 2 years, the pad just wouldn\'t stay on at all, so I removed it.I was at the end of my warranty (2 days left to expiration), but I shot them an email telling them about the problem. I had already even discarded the rubber pad, so they couldn\'t even verify that I was telling the truth. They said they\'d over look it though, \"Send it in, we\'ll send you a brand new gamepad\"Razer has Great Products, and when something goes wrong, their Support team is even better.','2021-12-19 23:16:09',5,9,204),(451,'  So far I have been very pleased with this keyboard. There is one annoying thing. The keys are \"transposed\" (best way to describe it). For example. If you want to look at the \"?\" key - Normally this key has a \"?\" above the \"/\", indicating a \"Shift\" is needed. On this keyboard all \"Shift\"ed keys are labeled BELOW the normal character.','2021-12-19 23:16:10',5,19,204),(452,'  I\'ve had this keyboard a few months now, and even though the key travel is nice and positive, it just misses the mark compared to the two other keyboards (Das Keyboard and a Logitech G100) I use on other machines.The absence of discrete media volume controls has turned out to be a real pain for me.  I want to be able to change volume, skip tracks, and mute with a single button press, not a combination.The lighting is pure gimmick.  Too much light comes out between the keys, making it very hard to see the actual keycaps in less than perfect light.Changing the order of symbols on the number row (symbols under numbers) is utterly arbitrary and still makes no sense to me.  The terrible illumination means that the \"shifted\" symbols are illuminated way more than the number, which in turn means it take a fraction of a second longer to orientate yourself if you have to look down at the keyboard.And finally there\'s the app, which is creepy and intrusive but HAS to be running otherwise the keyboard drops into a psychedelic color strobe.edit: after months of trying to get used to it, I still hate it and have swapped to another brand.','2021-12-19 23:16:11',1,4,204),(453,'  Excellent keyboard, but some glitchesI love the feel of this keyboard, its customizability is excellent (probably better than the blackwidow in terms of looks)The glitches i have found with the keyboard is that the keyboard will flicker/flash one time the default pinkish color when opening and closing my laptop lid (turning on/off screen) and one of my custom profiles made it flicker randomly. But this is probably just a software glitch and will be fixed down the road. (It doesnt occur every time just sometimes)Edit: The bug previously mentioned has gone away, apparently an update fixed it or a reinstall of my OS (I installed Linux on my laptop, but decided to go back to windows for my main OS due to program compatibilities).however I have found a new glitch - somewhat hardware related - After a period of not using the keyboard I started typing and some keys wanted to stick for like a second, (seemed to be only 1 or 2 keys suffered with this) but the glitch quickly disappeared and haven\'t had it occur since.','2021-12-19 23:16:12',4,19,204),(454,'  So many options out there currently with mechanical keyboards I had a hard time deciding what to get. I personally don\'t mind spending more on something I will use so frequently, however 150+ range I felt was too much.. I am not on Virtus.Pro or NiP..I\'m a normal everyday, a bit obsessed cs gamer. I have to say I\'m super pleased with this keyboard. I had some old Logitech before and wore off most of the letters on the board, and hated squinting at the keyboard in the dark just to type lol (usually ended up typing kik instead).But seriously.. perfect blend of mechanical sound and not waking up your neighbors everytime you hit the space bar of a traditional mech. Keyboard. The ability to set profiles allows me to easily go from fps settings to plain old white like the MacBook Pro keyboard I love so much.  I never get tripped up on the sides of keys when I make quicker moves, and obviously handles day to day typing, programming, etc with easy. The only complaint I have with it is they inversed the symbols(shift+symbol) keys..not actually, but rather the placement of each symbol is inversed. Muscle memory has made this much of a non issue but on keys I rarely use I second guess myself','2021-12-19 23:16:13',5,3,204),(455,'  Why is it so LOUD? Do you have a boyfriend/girlfriend who\'s a night person while you\'re a morning person? If you wake up early to game while your significant other is still fast asleep  you may not have to worry about them for long. There\'s no way they will stay by your side when they are rudely awakened every morning but the loudest button clicks in existence - louder than the  clicking on your mouse. On the plus side, now your single and it doesn\'t matter how loud it is. Side note: the back light is bright enough to have to squint at the buttons to try and make them out, you could probably use it to get a nice tan, now time to get back out there, stud.','2021-12-19 23:16:14',1,19,204),(456,'  The keyboard came in two days, and i was excited. Upon opening the package i could tell they really think about the customer, the packaging keeping the keyboard in was very nice and sturdy. I plugged this baby in and launched synapse. It worked fine and needed to update. The colors work great the the program is easy to use unless you want to build your own scheme. The only problem i have as of right now would be there is a little bit of key wobble but not enough to affect the experience while using it. I give it a 4/5 also because the shift bound characters are actually on the bottom of the keys instead of the top. Using it a little bit and i should be use to it in no time. If you don\'t have 150 dollars to drop on the black widow chroma v2 then this is the keyboard for you. It still has the satisfying sound of the click, but isn\'t to loud at all. The colors are the same exact thing from the more expensive version. Heck you even get a wrist rest with it!EDIT: Just noticed that my \"O\" key doesnt click.','2021-12-19 23:16:15',3,14,204),(457,'  I wanted to like this keyboard, really. It feels great. No too loud, great tactile feedback.

(see picture where 1 key is set to a different color)In the end, I simply cannot accept a keyboard that needs 700MB of software simply to change colors, and even then occasionally forgets. I ended up returning this keyboard.','2021-12-19 23:16:16',2,20,204),(458,'  The keyboard is really nice.  It\'s solid, looks great, and sounds great.  There\'s just one problem.  I cannot type on it without constant double typing!  If I type really slow and push down one key at a time, I don\'t get double keys.  But if I type normally, like I am right now on a Corsair mechanical gaming keyboard, II geet douublee keyys connsstantlly.  It doesn\'t seem to be any key in particular.  They keyboard is brand new, so there should be no dirt or dust in the keys.  I\'m going to try a contact support today when they open (9 am PST).  If there isn\'t a reasonable way to resolve this issue, I will be force to request a return - this keyboard is defective and unusable as it is.UPDATE 9/4/2020:I contacted Razer support who had me try all of the normal things, like make sure my computer was turned on. ?  Then they had me update the firmware.  Bingo, that seems to have fixed the \"key spamming\" problem.I have changed my rating from one to two ⭐⭐ because while I am glad they were able to fix the problem with a firmware update, a problem this obvious should have been caught before the product went out  the door.  If you buy this keyboard, BE SURE TO UPDATE TO THE LATEST FIRMWARE IMMEDIATELY!UPDATE 9/8/2020:Since flashing the firmware, this keyboard has been delightful.  Changed to three stars.  ⭐⭐⭐','2021-12-19 23:16:17',3,12,205),(459,'  I just wanted to post this here to try and help others who are having an issue with some of the keys double-registering. Yes, it\'s true, we shouldn\'t have this issue on a brand new keyboard, and why it was released like this, is beyond me. However, not everyone has this issue, but a lot do, and I\'d like to help you fix it. And thankfully, it\'s really an easy fix.Go to Razer\'s website, click support, then keyboards. Next, click on Razer BlackWidow V3 Tenkeyless. This will bring up the support page for this particular keyboard. Next, click on the green text at top where it says \"View software, drivers and updates for download >\". After clicking that, you will see the Razer BlackWidow V3 Tenkeyless Firmware Updater Guide page. Clicking on download will open up the PDF firmware updating instructions. Inside of this PDF, there is the actual link to download the firmware, which, as of this posting, shows a Release Date: 17 Sep 2020. This could change at any time, should a newer update become available.Updating the firmware doesn\'t take long at all. And yes, it does fix the double-registering issue. I had the same issue with mine, after updating the firmware, everything has been working perfectly!As for the keyboard itself, I really like it. It\'s nice and compact. Looks and feels great to type on. Gaming with it has been great, too. More room for my mouse to fly around (when playing FPS games) with this smaller keyboard. RGB lighting looks very nice. Keyboard feels well made and sturdy. And it does have a metal top. It\'s exactly what I was looking for. I was planning on buying a set of Doubleshot PBT Keycaps, but honestly, I find the stock keycaps to be just fine. The lighting shines through the stock keycaps nice and bright, and I appreciate that.Possible cons for some. The Razer Green switches are pretty loud when bottoming out. The top plate of this keyboard is metal, which adds to the noise. So, if you type like a woodpecker pecking on a tree, you\'re going to be making a lot of noise! I wouldn\'t recommend using it in the library, or where others are trying to sleep, unless, of course, you want a shoe thrown upside your head! As far as I know, and I\'ve looked everywhere, Razer is selling this particular keyboard only with Green switches, as of now. Maybe Razer will soon release one with the quieter Yellow switches, if you prefer those.Another possible con for some, there is no onboard memory. Profiles and customizations are created and saved using Razer\'s Synapse software.I hope this post was helpful to you. Enjoy your new keyboard!And to the Razer support team, y\'all should be more active here on Amazon in helping your customers. Offering a solution to a problem publicly, would allow more people to see a possible solution to their problem(s). A look through these keyboard reviews, and the questions section, I don\'t see a single response from Razer. I mean no disrespect at all, but from what I can see here, Razer COULD do a better job interacting with it\'s customers.','2021-12-19 23:16:18',4,14,205),(460,'            Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n        \n\n\n   So this keyboard is clicky and nice. Colors are nice. My fiancé has a V2 (this being a V3) and mine has the media keys which are nice but they took to Aux and USB ports. They also took away the macro buttons....my biggest problem overall is the V2 came with a plush wrist pad. This one is “Ergonomic, Magnetic Wrist Rest: Made of plush leatherette to maximize comfort over extended gaming sessions”.....or- plastic. It’s literally plastic. Not magnetic, not even plastic all the through (it’s hollow) with a leather “texture” (like they just laid a thin stamp when it was being made) on the plastic. It’s all one kind of plastic. Not even a fake pleather or anything. No cushion once so ever. So I’m kinda let down by that also Amazon delivered it in the rain in the box with a shipping label smacked on it. If I had went to work 30 minutes earlier the entire thing would’ve been soaked because it wasn’t in the normal plastic shopping bad or an extra box. Not to mention I live in a college town so a lot of people would’ve realized I had a nice in box keyboard just sitting right outside my house.','2021-12-19 23:16:19',4,9,205),(461,'  I bought this keyboard for my 16 year old son for Christmas. He was having issues with the keyboard double typing letters, so he proactively contacted Razer for help. Razer agreed to send him a new keyboard since it is under warranty, but they needed him to send proof of purchase. First I sent him a screenshot of the order with payment details. That wasn\'t good enough, they needed the receipt. So I downloaded the invoice and saved it as a PDF. Through the next several emails with the Razer support team, they continued to send examples of Amazon UK receipts, how to video on how to pull receipts from Amazon UK, and the same repeated written instructions on how to pull a receipt, because my invoice did not look like the Amazon UK invoice. My son and I explained repeatedly that we are in the US and Amazon US invoices look different. I suggested they contact Amazon to confirm or call me on FaceTime so I can show them how I pulled the invoice and what it looks like. The answer was another email with instructions on how to pull the receipt. Luckily, due to the holidays, I\'m still within the return timeframe with Amazon. If Razer doesn\'t fix this, I\'ll be returning it. What a waste of my time.','2021-12-19 23:16:20',1,6,205),(462,'  First off you cant register the product, reg and serial number always wrong very frustrating to even get that far 10 times is my max trying. the software crashes 3 minutes into setting the board up and cant keep the wave pattern to stay. What is wrong with this company? Going back to my SoundBlaster Vanguard.Update---July 22 2021 still cannot keep the software working, deleted everything down to the registry and no go. Had also bought the pink keyboard for my daughter and she put it into the closet due to it being way too noisy. Maybe I can strip mine out and rebuild hers the keys are soldered in so replacing the switches is out of the question. She loved the Ornate so she\'s back to that. Think twice ppl before buying!','2021-12-19 23:16:21',1,1,205),(463,'  So, a disclaimer. I\'ve genuinely always liked Razer products. From the way they\'ve felt to the way they look, I\'ve always been a fan. When I saw they re-did my favorite keyboard series, the Blackwidow, I was quite happy! Looked for days and days and days for the yellow keys to this board, and I was so happy when I finally got it! Opened the package, instantly disappointed upon seeing the wrist rest. Refer to the picture, the wrist rest that came with this one is on the left...It\'s a block. A literal plastic block, no cushion, nothing. The one I\'m using now is of my previous board, the Blackwidow Elite.Upon even typing this review, I\'ve noticed many more flaws with this board. The shift key needs to be JAMMED down for it register, pressing space like you would normally will sometime\'s simply just not register. It sounds amazing to type on and the keycaps feel great! But this board? It\'s really bad. If you want a Blackwidow, get the elite. I can\'t recommend this to anyone.','2021-12-19 23:16:22',2,20,205),(464,'  I grew-up coveting mechanical keyboards, like the IBM/Lexmark Model M, with their split-spring switches, or the NorthGate keyboards with their Alps switches. This keyboard is old-school loud, with the Green switched (similar to Cherry MX Blue switches). Personally, I like a colicky keyboard, but my office is in my basement, far from where it can bother someone else. Overall, tactile feedback, switch action, key pitch and travel, is exactly what I like from a typing standpoint. Overall, the build quality is very good, though not industry-best. That said, in the 7 months that I’ve had this keyboard, I’ve had zero problems with it (including programming custom lighting schemes, and having no issues with my USB KVM switch). Overall, this is an outstanding mechanical keyboard.','2021-12-19 23:16:23',5,6,205),(465,'  **UPDATE 10/13/21.-Returned it. Issues with it disconnecting from my PC constantly despite USB port. If you have the V2, stick with that one. The V3 feels and looks more generic in my opinion.Okay, so recently I\'ve owned the blackwidow v2. If you\'re coming from a cheaper mechanical keyboard or want to go tenkeyless, or just want to upgrade, this is a great keyboard. However, if you already have the blackwidow TE V2 TKL, I would recommend you stick with it. For starters, this keyboard is $30 more than the V2 and doesn\'t come with a wrist rest. Not a dealbreaker since I don\'t use wrist rests, but it\'s missing that. Another thing is that there is no detachable cable. Again, not a dealbreaker if you\'re at a PC you never move, but some people like that portability. Another thing, minor cosmetic difference, is that the razer logo below the spacebar does not illuminate. I will say the V3 TKL is much more simple, minimalistic, the keys aren\'t recessed and are easier to clean. The black top plate is nice, I like the fact that there are LED lights to let you know if the caps, scroll lock, etc are enabled.  RGB is great and can get pretty bright. But also, another difference I have noticed between V2 and the V3 is the keycaps. The keycaps on the V3 feel much more resilient and durable, font is slightly larger. I love the green switches, compared to G1 greens, these definitely don\'t have much wobble to them. Overall you can\'t go wrong with the V3 TKL, if you need that numpad the full size is literally $10 more and it also has a dedicated volume wheel and media key and comes with a wrist rest. But if you\'re limited on desk space or prefer to ditch the numpad, the V3 TKL is a okay option.','2021-12-19 23:16:24',3,6,205),(466,'  I picked this up to replace a Razer BlackWidow Elite that I have only had for about 20 months. The Elite has an issue with the volume scroll wheel (basically it doesn\'t work anymore). I love everything about the Elite, with the exception being that scroll wheel.I picked this keyboard as a replacement as the scroll wheel appears to be a better design that may last longer, and I like that the lighting shows through both the primary and shift+key alternates (the elite doesn\'t..). However, that is all I can say that is good about this keyboard vs the Elite.The BlackWidow V3 appears to be all plastic. It has an interesting amount of weight to it, but it feels like it\'s all plastic. The wrist rest is definitely 100% plastic and basically just lays on your desk. The Elite has magnets that keep it in place, and the Elite Wrist Rest is foam padded and much nicer to your wrists. There is a backlit Razer Logo in the middle of the front on the Elite as well that is a nice touch if you choose to go without the wrist rest. The V3 is just more plastic, no logo, or lighting.The Elite also has a 3.5mm audio jack and USB-A port on the left side that helps minimize cords to and from your PC.I fully understand that the Elite is $60-70 more, but that $60-70 extra appears to get you a lot more. I mean I honestly believe that getting a Cynosa V2 and any wrist rest you want is a much better purchase. I may go to a Corsair for my next keyboard. Really disappointed with the Razer BlackWidow V3.','2021-12-19 23:16:25',1,12,205),(467,'  I do like the clacky-ness of this Razer keyboard, this is the 3rd Razer keyboard I\'ve owned.  The multi-media button and roller are a unique idea, mostly i use it for PC volume adjustment and it works great for that.The wrist rest is just a plastic wedge that doesn\'t really connect to the keyboard in any way .  I at least expected a bit of padding on it but there is none, it\'s literally a plastic wedge you slide up next to the keyboard.The LED lighting on this keyboard is not very bright, i have the brightness at 100 and it\'s much duller than my other two keyboards.  On the other hand my other two keyboards had a bit of a frame around the grouping of keys. This one is open, the keys sit atop the base there\'s no frame maybe this causes diffused lighting.Anyway it\'s fine it works.  I don\'t LOVE it but it does what it needs to.  And i have to say.. the lighting configuration stuff has become stupidly complicated now i just want my keyboard to light up green and there is a ridiculous amount of steps to go through to do that.  Lighting was so much easier in Synapse 1.  Honestly i wish i could just buy a keyboard with green lights like they used to come with back in BlackWidow 1 days instead of having ot futz with all this chroma complexity now.','2021-12-19 23:16:26',4,13,205),(468,'  After playing with this keyboard for a day, I believe I\'ve figured out all of the LED functions, including custom recordings and full anti-ghosting.CUSTOM LED RECORDING===If you notice, FN+INS will cycle you through the various light settings, including one where the arrow keys, WASD and ESC key lights up. This is actually the first of 8 different haphazard LED settings, which you can access by hitting FN+1 through 8. They do not have any apparent rhyme or reason to them, so we will ignore them. If you wish to record custom LEDs, you want to use FN+9 and FN+0, which are blank on first blush. Only then do the instructions to hit FN+END to start/stop recording actually work. You will notice it working by the 3 lights next to your arrow keys flashing blue during the record phase.FN+ESC will delete your custom LEDs and reset the keyboard entirely.FULL ANTI-GHOSTING===The instructions are further confusing here, as they have FN+PRTSC labeled as \"6 keys anti-conflicting\" - and while this is actually true, this does not give you FULL anti-ghosting. In order to access that, you must hit FN+SCRLK.Further note that FN+ESC will reset your anti-ghosting back to 6.MISC===Beyond those functions, FN+DEL, FN+HOME, FN+PGUP, and FN+PGDN will activate additional LED settings.FN+LEFT and FN+RIGHT arrow keys will slow down / speed up the rate at which the lights activate.FN+DOWN and FN+UP arrow keys will adjust the brightness.','2021-12-19 23:16:27',4,19,206),(469,'            Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n        \n\n\n   This thing is so well made. The lights are beautiful. Not as customizable as I would like. But many cool settings like having the keys go dark when they have been pressed. Great mechanical feel to it very happy!','2021-12-19 23:16:28',5,7,206),(470,'  Though the switches are advertised as \"blue\", they clearly are not genuine Cherry MX Blue switches.  These switches have a click to them, but the tactile response and sound are lacking.  The keys have a squishy, almost membranous feel to them, despite clearly having mechanical switches.  I had hoped this would feel similar to another knock-off no-name brand keyboard I had purchased in the past, but I simply could not get over the spongy feel of these keys.  It may be perfectly fine for most applications, but if you have the means to purchase a more expensive keyboard with genuine Cherry switches (and you can tell the difference), then you\'ll be better off with another keyboard.Note:  As others have mentioned, more combinations than just Fn+Ins trigger the various LED patterns.  It appears that the buttons Ins, Home, PgUp, PgDn all have 3 different patterns. Fn+arrow keys control the brightness and the cycle speed for lighting effects.  Good variety of animations overall and it is nice to see a keyboard with built in features that does not require additional bloatware to be installed.','2021-12-19 23:16:29',3,10,206),(471,'  I bought this keyboard as a replacement for a different brand that my son had spilt coffe in. I was expecting much, given the price, but the feel is good, the board has enough weight to stay in place and the keys have a good feel and travel. It\'s a full size keyboard with numeric keypad. It doesn\'t really have dedicated media keys (although you can use some chords to get them), but that doesn\'t matter to me as I never used them anyway. One interesting feature is that the switches are mounted in the top plate of the keyboard, so there\'s nothing around the keycaps to trap crumbs and detritus, it\'s easy to use compressed air to blow out dirt around the keys and keep the board clean. It also has braided nylon insulation on the cord, so that should hold up better than the standard PVC insulation you normally see. I\'m probably going to buy a second one as a spare.','2021-12-19 23:16:30',5,4,206),(472,'  This keyboard is just awful. All of the LEDs are some random brightness. Most of them are too dim, very few are bright. It\'s as if some of the LEDs are defective and dim. The letters and numbers are in some weird font with a black vertical line down the center of them. For what purpose? To make them hard to decipher? Why did they even bother making this trash?','2021-12-19 23:16:31',1,13,206),(473,'  This keyboard is AWESOME! Plug and play, easy setup. The backlit colors are very cool (see images). The keys are very well made and solid. The touch feels so good that I can\'t stop typing with this keyboard. I truly love this mechanical keyboard and at this price it is definitely a steal.','2021-12-19 23:16:32',5,18,206),(474,'  So, if you\'re looking for a light show from your keyboard, this isn\'t going to impress, the color pattern is set, you can turn it off, and there are a couple of other settings to play with, but it\'s not a real feature of the board.That being said, I wasn\'t looking for a light show, I wanted a good working keyboard that would last longer than the standard keyboards, and specifically I wanted a mechanical keyboard.This keyboard has some bells and whistles, but it\'s clean and tidy, without bulky trim.It\'s simple, has a pretty small footprint for a full sized keyboard, and the switches are very responsive. Comes with a key cap puller.Overall, this is a great value for the price.','2021-12-19 23:16:33',5,5,206),(475,'  I was looking for a clackety keyboard, and this was the best deal I could find.  The lights behind the keys aren\'t important to me -- in fact, they\'re somewhat distracting if you aren\'t used to it -- but another reviewer gave some good tips on how to customize the lighting.  Hitting FUNCTION + (INS or HOME or PGUP or PGDN or END or DEL) changes the light pattern; FUNCTION + UP/DOWN changes the brightness (or turns the LEDs off), and FUNCTION + LEFT/RIGHT changes the speed of the LED motion.I\'ve been using this to type quite a bit for the last six months and haven\'t had any problems.  I\'m a graduate student so it\'s a LOT of typing... this keyboard is getting the job done and I sound like a badass while I\'m gettin\' it done.  Worth the money.','2021-12-19 23:16:34',4,15,206),(476,'  Had one problem for 30 seconds with a sticky key. A key was pushed to the left just a little too far and stuck.

I\'m very pleased with this keyboard.','2021-12-19 23:16:35',5,20,206),(477,'  Finally finished building my computer and put everything together. This keyboard was what I was looking for along with my budget. The design and features were great. Very sturdy and responsive. Most of the keyboards that I was looking for didn\'t have a 10 key or if it did it was super bulky for some reason. It does have a clicky noise to it but I\'m sure all mechanical keyboards are like that. One of my favorite things is the RGB light, probably because I never had backlights before.  Installation was literally plugged/play and detected by Windows 10 PC.','2021-12-19 23:16:36',5,10,206),(478,'  I dont often leave reviews but I thought I should on this one. I love corsair products but this keyboard kind of stinks and here’s why... First off the positives, the wrist pad is great and very comfortable, the RGB lighting and connectivity is wonderful and the key feel/response is about what you would expect. Now for the negatives, the keyboard makes the most annoying cling sound I’ve ever heard when typing. Every key pressed even if pressed slightly has a cling sound. This sound comes from the metal plate that although esthetically pleasing picks up the vibration from each press and creates this annoying sound that just gets more noticeable with time. Another horrible aspect of this keyboard is the look. From the top view it’s great but looking from a side vide or an angle, which most people will be seeing this keyboard from, you see  a horrible white plastic under each key. This white plastic looks cheap and bad, when the RGB is lit it’s fine but when it’s off it makes the keyboard look like something you picked up in the children’s  toy section. Overall, not worth a $100 and one of the poorest quality keyboards I have ever seen from Corsair. I returned this item and purchased the K95 on sale which is far superior but costs more and still has a cling sound but for some reason seems to be less noticeable.*sorry for no pics I was so disgusted I repackaged it and returned as soon as possible. But I’m sure their is something online talking about this. See and listen for yourself before buying.','2021-12-19 23:16:37',2,9,209),(479,'  so after using the CORSAIR Strafe RGB for about 2.5 years, I have a job and need an expensive nice keyboard for work so I decided of course get a nice corsair again! Well I\'m at work typing this, and I\'m embarrassed to type because its so loud! the keys make a loud ping and then then space bar dear god..... Its like this--->PING ping PING BONG!! *Touches keys and releases slower* Ping Ping BONG!!! ping ping BONGGGG! so yeah if you wanna ring a Chinese gong every time you hit space this... THIS is for you!','2021-12-19 23:16:38',2,10,209),(480,'  I was interested in the K60 since it was announced. The new Cherry Viola switches perked my interest. After using the board for about a week now here are my thoughts:- Definitely worth getting the SE just for the wrist rest. Great quality and super comfortable!- The RGB really pops on this board. I like that I have so many options on the board itself as I\'ve never been a huge fan of the iCue software.- The Viola switches are interesting. The board more or less functions like a linear switch while gaming. The responsiveness has been really nice.- The switches are very quite. If that\'s the kind of board you are looking for then this is absolutely the board for you.- Again it\'s worth getting the SE just for the PBT keycaps, they are really nice. Not seeing grime, residue or marks building up. The RGB really shines through nice as well.','2021-12-19 23:16:39',5,6,209),(481,'  I spent a lot of time researching gaming keyboards while trying to find something that would suit my needs for work too. When I came across this keyboard initially, I was skeptical since I thought I would prefer brown switches (quiet with a preference for a tactile bump); I had never used linear switches before, so although it felt like a risk, it TOTALLY paid off. This keyboard is insanely comfortable, quiet, and honestly looks amazing.- AESTHETICS: The RGB lighting is ridiculously saturated and the brushed aluminum finish provides such a clean look. I do like that there are onboard lighting modes/options since I can’t download the customization software onto my work laptop (also a nice option for those whose work laptops use Linux since a lot of keyboard lighting software isn’t compatible).- KEYCAPS: I appreciate that Corsair went with a cleaner font for the key caps (small detail, but to me it adds to the clean look of this keyboard). The key caps do leave some fingerprinting/residue behind on occasion, but to me it’s never been very noticeable or bothersome.- PORTS: There is no USB or audio port built into the keyboard, for which I have to say at least a USB port would’ve been nice (I imagine this would’ve been tougher with the limitations of a low profile build, though).- LOW PROFILE BUILD & SWITCHES:  I will say that the low profile build, especially in this case with the Cherry MX low profile speed switches that have a smaller actuation distance than typical, may not be everyone’s preference. I personally feel like the switches provide such a nice response and keep me from bottoming out, which is nice from an ergonomic standpoint. For others though, I can see that it might feel too sensitive and induce extra typos. It wasn’t the case for me at all, and overall I would say this keyboard totally met all of my needs.','2021-12-19 23:16:40',5,2,209),(482,'  This keyboard is actually really difficult to use; I keep constantly having to backspace if I try to type at a proper speed because a key triggered twice or I also got another key next to it somehow (not a problem I have ever had with any other keyboard!) and then the backspace key is really unresponsive, I have to hit it really hard or clicking several times only gets a single backspace and so even my fix-that-typo muscle memory isn\'t getting the right results because usually I get another key or two forward before I notice an error and I\'ll hit backspace twice three times real quick and keep going but it only actually backspaces once and so it\'s still wrong. This seems to occur with other keys I want to hit twice in quick succession as well, for example nearly every time I type the word \"actually,\" which is often, I get \"actualy\" unless I slow down and hit the L key much more deliberately.It\'s driving me up the wall and I think I\'m going to have to return it.edit: I gave it a chance for a week and I thiiiink I might be getting used to it? I\'m going to give it a little longer to see if my problem is just that I need to learn how to mechanical keyboard','2021-12-19 23:16:41',2,6,209),(483,'  This is the second time I\'m editing this review. Out of the box I loved this keyboard, then disliked it as soon as I used it, then overall liked it after a couple days, accepting I would have to use the poor-quality keycaps that this thing came with. After using it for a few months, I hate it.I got the low profile, and the keycaps immediately started to wear/shine. Immediately meaning within an hour and a half of use. I tried other keycaps but even cherry profile are too high to work with these switches. If you get some of those typewriter-style keycaps they would probably work fine but if you want sculpted keycaps you\'re stuck with these ones.I tried really hard, for months, to like this keyboard. I kept telling myself I\'d get used to it, that the duplicated keystrokes we\'re just me not being used to the Cherry MX speed switches, etc etc. Towards the end I was trying so hard because I dropped almost $100 on this thing. Nope. This keyboard stinks.As many other reviews mention, there\'s a big issue with duplicated keystrokes. If your main use of this will be typing, turn around now. My wpm dropped significantly from all the errors coming from this keyboard.Additionally, the switches are soldered in, so it\'s not hot swappable. Meaning you\'re stuck with garbage keycaps and overly sensitive/error-prone switches.I am leaving 2 stars because the lights are bright and the customization is nice. I like that you can \"create\" colors with the software. That said, pretty much any gaming keyboard has that, so.Overall this keyboard is way too expensive for all the issues and not being able to customize it. You\'re basically paying for a name which doesn\'t live up to the price or hype.I ended up swallowing the ~$100 loss and buying a much better-quality, much cheaper brand keyboard that I know to be reliable. This heap now sits in the storage closet in case I ever need a backup or something.','2021-12-19 23:16:42',2,7,209),(484,'  I own a lot of mechanical keyboards; it\'s a bit of an addiction. When my wife\'s Logitech G512 was starting to die, she needed another full-sized keyboard. She\'s become very used to the low travel linear switches, so finding something comparable to the 512 was a bit of a chore. I was surprised by how good the switches on this board feel for being their more budget option. Now don\'t get me wrong, they\'re not as good as a high-end switch, but they feel and sound good as well. The lighting on this board is fantastic. The colors are bright and saturated, with excellent coverage of the spectrum. The Corsair keyboard stands out compared to a Razer keyboard, whose colors look washed out and dim. The only thing that took a little while to get used to is the low profile keys, which feel a little more cramped at first; I don\'t know why because the spacing is no different from a standard keyboard. I think this is just a product of switching from a board you\'ve been using for years. After a day of use, my wife felt right at home with the new board.','2021-12-19 23:16:43',5,7,209),(485,'  Used this keyboard for not even one week and  the space bar just started double spacing.

I was intrigued by the idea of switches that trigger in a linear way, sit higher up than the low laptop like solar powered keyboard, but not be full height and travel like a regular \"gaming\" keyboard. And this K60 LP is the perfect middle ground. Love the RGB, subtle but useful. I like the full layout as I use the num pad for work. Solid aluminium chassis. Only negative and I am being picky - it lacks media buttons and volume scroller, but you have access to volume and skip track vi FN+ F5 to F12 keys. The keys trigger at around the 0.8mm mark with is fantastic for touch typing. I love the choice I made. I added a wrist wrest to reduce pronation of my wrists when typing. Only downside is that at the office, I do not have this same keyboard... oh well.','2021-12-19 23:16:45',5,19,209),(487,'  I oordered this keyboard oon 7/04/2021 and am alreadyy having issues.

The keyboard starting doing over 13 THOUSAND key strokes a second, opening all type of apps, settings, you name it. After all that my PC finally crashed but the damage this caused was so bad I was forced to reformat my PC.','2021-12-19 23:16:47',1,11,210),(489,'  The review is about the Apex Pro Keyboard, NOT Apex 7.Adjusting the actuation is great! I can feel the difference in games with their super fast actuation. Typing is just the reverse though, I have a lot of typos with the super fast actuation. Which isn\'t a problem at all, because you can switch profiles on the fly and have one of the best typing experiences imaginable with super deep 3.6 mm actuation point. It\'s like having multiple keyboards at once, and being able to change them effortlessly to suit the task at hand.Some disadvantages I\'d like to point out:- Not waterproof. Be careful with it.- Only the main block uses omnipoint switches. Not a big issue considering you don\'t really use the other keys, but that\'s a good reason to make a 60% or TKL Keyboard with only omnipoint switches, no? After using TKL keyboards I\'ve really appreciate the extra space. I highly recommend the TKL version over the full one, once it actually releases.- O-rings will prevent the 3.6mm actuation point from working properly, and I really didn\'t like how O-rings felt on this keyboard. Not really an issue considering that the keyboard is already quite silent even without any O-rings.','2021-12-19 23:16:48',5,18,210),(490,'  I\'m on the fence with this keyboard, so I\'m giving it stars down the middle to represent not bad, not great.First up the price. Well, it\'s not worth what I paid for by any means. I did keep the keyboard, so I can safely say that I wasted some $$ on this. Half the price would be more reasonable.Rest of the keyboard is about as others have reviewed. The colors and software you run (I\'m on Win10x64) all work well and I\'ve had no issues. I already owned a SteelSeries mouse, so there wasn\'t any additional setup for me on the software front. The keyboard showed up in their software and I was immediately able to start playing around with settings. As I expected, this is a rather clicky keyboard - if there were 5 or so clicking at the same time, you\'d think you were in a news room. My previous keyboards were much softer touch and produced next to no sound, so the difference is a bit jarring at times. I\'d tried to switch over to a more standard gaming keyboard several times over the past couple years and this is the latest attempt.There are a couple things I was disappointed in and one of them I guess was just ignorance on my part of what the thing does. First up, the software works like crap when you put it in the dual mode to keep colors in sync between a keyboard and mouse. Settings are suddenly limited to lowest common denominator, so if you have thoughts of doing this, forget it. Fairly easy to just set up each separately to kind of match.Second up is this adjustable pressure. Silly me, I thought it would actually adjust the pressure you \"could\" apply to the keys. Well, that\'s not the case. It\'s influences the amount of pressure you \"need\" to apply to the key to get it to see the key was pushed. On the lightest touch setting, just barely rubbing your finger across the key will trigger a push. And then on the highest setting, you have to push all the way down on the key. While this is supposed to be the big selling point of this keyboard, it\'s not that impressive. It does work as advertised, now that I understand the advertising. It just doesn\'t seem to make any difference in what I do at all. I\'ve been PC gaming since the 2 color screen days, so I\'ve used so many different keyboards, I can\'t count them all. This is just another one to me. I\'m likely to never remember back and think \"holy button push\", that was a pivotal moment with this awesome keyboard!That said, this isn\'t a bad keyboard at all. I\'m keeping and testing to see if my years of typing possibly change as I use it. I like the colors. I like the extra USB plug. I\'m on the fence about the little wheel and useless screen in the upper right.If you\'ve got $$ burning a hole in your pocket, go for it. If you\'re debating on spending this much for something and not sure if it\'s worth it, it\'s not.','2021-12-19 23:16:49',3,16,210),(491,'  Unsure if these issues were because I bought it renewed, but here we go. Keyboard is very comfortable, construction quality seems to be pretty high. Unfortunately so is the key sensitivity, which I assume can be adjusted. You will find that keys will register as being pushed when they weren\'t. It\'s a deal breaker for online games like over watch where abilities have cool downs and the keyboard decides to use them without you touching keys. It also is kind of a bummer when trying to type in general as certain keys will \"stick\" and type 1000 times. Luckily, I returned the keyboard the day I got it as the problems were immediately apparent and went back to my old one. Still searching for a more comfortable keyboard that\'s good for gaming!','2021-12-19 23:16:50',1,10,210),(492,'  I got this and a Rival wired mouse for my son’s birthday.  He plays a lot of Roblox with his friends and I constantly hear him hammer fisting his desk in anger because his wireless keyboard and mouse would lag and make him vulnerable in shooter games.  He was so excited to get the keyboard and mouse.  Not only does it look super cool, but you can adjust the actuation of the keys.  You can make it so you barely have to touch the key, to fully pressing the key all the way down in order to send the command.  The keyboard feels like it\'s built to last, nice and sturdy, and has a real nice mechanical feel when typing.  I pop in every now and then when he\'s playing a Roblox shooter game with his friends and ask if the keyboard and mouse are working alright.  He always tells me they work flawlessly, in fact he said his click speed is a lot faster now.  I\'m not gamer, but I understand your competition will kick your butt if you\'re playing with sub par tools.  It\'s been a week and I have yet to hear any angry hammer fisting of his desk.?  In fact, I was watching him play the other night when a Roblox YouTuber joined his server.  He got all excited  and said the person was one of the highest ranked players in the game he was playing.  He took out the YouTuber several times, but ultimately came in second to him each round until the YouTuber moved on.  My son was totally stoked and said there\'s no way he would have been able to compete with the old wireless keyboard and mouse.  Awesome, you don\'t always hit a home run with presents, but this might be one.  If only it would make him excited to do his homework.?','2021-12-19 23:16:51',5,6,210),(493,'  I\'ve been looking for a worthy replacement for my Logitech 810, a no-frills, mechanical, RGB keyboard with a relatively small footprint, and this SteelSeries Apex Pro is everything I need and nothing I don\'t.The finish is a pleasant feeling matte black which looks nice and doesn\'t show fingerprints. The edges are also rounded which makes using the keyboard on my lap more comfortable. Construction feels solid but the keyboard is relatively light weight and doesn\'t feel cumbersome to lift or move.I\'m not an expert on switches but the keys feel really nice. I messed around a bit with the adjustable actuation software, and it\'s pretty cool, though I ended up sticking with the default setting. The lighting is lovely, bright, and sufficiently customizable. One feature about the lighting that made me want to buy this keyboard is that the SHIFT characters on the number row keys are illuminated. It\'s baffling how more expensive competing products fail to do that.The mini OLED screen on the keyboard is more or less worthless for practical real-world use, but it\'s aesthetically pleasing, and you can add your own image, so I\'m not mad. I was concerned because one Youtube review described the OLED/media scroll and button as feeling cheap and flimsy, but I don\'t find that to be true.If I had to criticize anything, I\'d say the footprint might actually be too small. There is practically nowhere to grip the keyboard if you have to pick it up. First world problems.','2021-12-19 23:16:52',5,10,210),(494,'  When a rogue Win 10 update took out my Gskill KM780 RGB unexpectedly, I had to pull the trigger fast on a new KB instead of having to endure using my spare membrane board.  After a solid day of research, I took a chance on the Apex Pro.Coming from Cherry MX Browns, I had some reservations about OmniPoint.  The Browns have a tactile point which I liked.  I had tried MX Reds, and wasn\'t a fan of the linear feel.  With these Omni switches being linear, I was unsure but somehow compelled to pass on the Apex 7 with MX Browns and go Pro.  TBH, I was half expecting to return it.  Needless to say.... I was surprised when I hooked this up!First off... dat switch.  Wow.  SUPER smooth.  The inherent scratchiness of linear MX switches is GONE.  It feels like the keycaps are just sort of floating over the brushed aluminum base.  The adjustment ability is unique compared to most mechanical boards, bringing a true Hall Effect switch to people.  (Look up Hall Effect... gets a little complex for explanation here, but very cool)  Actuation can be adjusted from a light brush on the keys (probably overkill) to making the switch bottom out completely.  This can also be done on a per key basis. Lot of range to play with!Another key strength... the RGB lighting.  Its nothing short of fantastic.  The raised caps let the bright and vibrant lighting spill over the board itself, creating a very cool and clean lighting effect.  Even for those who don\'t much care about RGB lighting, it\'s very tastefully done here.Typing is unreal.  I spent 15 mins just typing random weirdness on a word doc just for them feels when I first hooked it up.  And for some reason, I find myself with a lot less errors compared to old board with the Browns.  I\'d commonly get keypress duplication (as if I held the key down) with that switch, and with these Omni switches, it doesn\'t happen anymore.  Of course, these Omni switches are much quieter than the tactile Browns given their linear nature.Not much bad to say here.  Some minor gripes would be somewhat \"meh\" software from Steelseries and the keycaps being ABS instead of something like double-shot PBT caps.  The latter feel much sturdier and more premium, and I suppose one could buy some PBT caps if it was a huge issue.  Not sure how that would affect the lighting though.  The small B&W OLED screen in the upper right doesn\'t add much in reality, but its kind of a geeky fun thing that you can customize with whatever you want.  It does have some functionality with brightness and other features, which is nice to have versus having to use the software.  Also, only the primary keys have Omni switches.  All the F keys, num pad, and extra function keys are on a generic linear switch that feels good enough.  Would be nice to have all keys on omni switches, but it makes sense from a cost perspective and isn\'t a big deal to me.All in all, fantastic keyboard that towers over my old Gskill in every respect.  I really wish MS terrible updates hadn\'t bricked old board, but I guess things happen for a reason.  If you have the cash and want a great analog-based mechanical keyboard with adjustable hall effect switches.... this is the one for you.  Very hard to fault this board.  Steelseries done good here.','2021-12-19 23:16:53',5,5,210),(495,'  UPDATE: I still really like this keyboard, but I was starting to notice that I actually type really inaccurately on it - it does get annoying. I just make a lot of mistakes, and I\'ve been typing for 40 years and normally type about 100wpm. I was trying to figure out why this is, and lately I\'ve had my old IBM Model M in the room hooked up to another computer and have felt the obvious difference in accuracy. (The Model M is where the modern keyboard layout comes from.) I still just type much better on the Model M. So I directly compared the two keyboards to figure out what the difference is.Obviously the Model M is bigger overall, but my big realization is that the actual key layout on the Model M is slightly wider. It\'s not just a difference in the \"dead space\" in between keyboard sections, either - there is actually slightly less space between each key on the Steelseries keyboard. I\'ve compared all the keyboards I\'ve owned against the Model M and while some have had minor layout variations and most these days have the function keys much closer to the main keys, this is the first time I\'ve seen keys that were actually closer together. I\'m sure it\'s not the only keyboard like that, but it\'s the only one I\'ve owned that is and it explains my typing inaccuracy on it. I\'ve taken a star off my original review for that reason. It is just not a full size keyboard, even though it looks like it is. It feels cramped, and I\'ve never gotten fully adjusted to it.My original review is below:----------------------------------------For the price, it had better be good. And it is. My score is 5 stars but consider it more like 4 1/2 rounded up. A bit closer to 5 than 4; not perfect but nearly so. I\'ll explain.I\'m both a typist and a gamer, but these days probably more of the former than the latter. Still, I try to find keyboards good for both purposes, and many are - heck, the old IBM Model M is still a great gaming keyboard if you don\'t need n-key rollover (and to be honest, most people really don\'t). But my old Motospeed keyboard, which I loved for its feel and its small footprint (as small as it gets for a full size keyboard) seemed to just wear out - it started repeating keypresses constantly, so I decided I\'d just go for something new rather than try to fix it. (But I probably will fix it at some point; it\'s a great keyboard too.)This is the first linear keyboard I\'ve owned in many years. I usually prefer clicky keyboards and have since the days of the original IBM PC and the Model F. But I just wanted something different after owning clicky keyboards for so long, and my Motospeed was *really* clicky to the point that it did become a little grating after a few years. I\'d read about the wonders of the OmniPoint keyswitches in the Apex Pro and I watched the excellent Chyrosran22 review of it on YouTube (search for that; he knows keyboards and he loves this one). I did also manage to try one out for a brief few minutes, though not long enough to really form my own opinion. But in the absence of any more obvious choice, I took the plunge and bought one.Bottom line: It is a really well built keyboard (almost zero flex) that feels *almost* as good to type on as any linear keyboard I\'ve ever used in about 40 years of computing. It has double-shot keycaps so the legends won\'t wear out, it\'s got a really useful volume roller, and it\'s got a little screen that can be used for various things, most of which are kinda dumb but I do use it for displaying current system stats - there is an app to display CPU, GPU and RAM usage. Its backlighting is pretty bright, fully RGB and has some effects that are actually kinda useful - I\'m not sure what the effect I use is called, but it just lights the key you press up in white for a half-second or so before smoothly fading it back to whatever color the rest of the keyboard is backlit in. It\'s actually helpful to have a little split-second feedback showing which key you just typed, just in case you make a mistake.The OnmiPoint keyswitches do feel great - very smooth - and they\'re user-adjustable in terms of the actuation point. This is unique to this type of keyswitch, which is an uncommon magnetic sensor type of mechanical switch. I will say that I *feel* more accurate on this keyboard than my old Motospeed - I think the design and spacing of the keycaps on this keyboard is maybe a little more standard.So, that\'s that - now I\'m going to tell you about the *little* things that keep it from being perfect. Keep in mind that absolutely none of these are dealbreakers, or things other people might even necessarily think of as drawbacks. But...The cord is non-detachable and it\'s quite stiff. It\'s also just rubber insulated, which is fine, but kinda ugly on such an expensive keyboard. The keyboard has two USB plugs, one for the USB port on the keyboard itself (it won\'t act as a hub, just a pass-through), and that USB plug is on the left side of the keyboard. That means if you want the keyboard cable on the right, which the cable management on the back of the keyboard lets you do, your mouse cable will still be on the left. I feel like this is an odd design given that most people are right-handed. A choice would be best, but if you\'re going to pick a place for one USB port, put it on the right.Only the \"main\" keys are OmniPoint - that\'s everything in the little \"typewriter\" cluster, that main rectangle of letters and numbers that you type the most on. The others are either Cherry MX Red or some kind of copy of them. To be honest, I\'m not sure which switch I prefer! I know which I\'m \"supposed\" to prefer but the regular Reds on the rest of the keyboard seem to have a very slightly lighter weighting. Probably my only semi-serious complaint about the keyboard in general - and this is 100% subjective, so it\'s not a top-line item for this review - is that the OmniPoint switches are just a *tiny* bit heavier than I like, and probably as a consequence of that feel very, very slightly \"mushy\" as you reach full travel. The switches on the rest of the board, while very slightly \"grittier\", are also a tiny bit lighter and do not feel mushy. All that said, I will allow that someone else could feel entirely the opposite. This is personal preference, and anyway it\'s not a big difference. But there *is* a difference in the switches on different parts of the board, and it does sometimes feel a little odd as a result.After only several *days* of use, the soft-touch finish is already wearing off several of the keys. Now, you can see by this review that I type a *lot*. So it may take longer for you, and anyway the legends themselves will never wear off since they\'re doubleshot. But my space bar is already looking a little ugly with one part of it already noticeably shiny. I never understand this - my Model F and Model M that are 30+ years old still look brand new, while a keyboard that\'s only days old (and cost a couple hundred bucks) already has a finish that\'s wearing off.Overall, though, I think I\'ll be happy with this keyboard until I get tired of linear keys and want to go back to clicky. But who knows when or if that\'ll happen. At the moment, I\'m pleased with my purchase, even for the money. This thing does feel like an expensive keyboard.','2021-12-19 23:16:54',4,19,210),(496,'  So, I just hoooked this up. I just don\'t know yet. I have not installed software or done much of anything yet.I just trashed my G710+, which was 12 years ole and I kept getting broken keys because I type a LOT since I\'m a software engineer. But I loved the keyboard so much, I really hated to let it go.This one, right off I can say it is not as \'clicky as the G710. I also so not like the wrist wrest, at all. I don\'t like the feel of it. It\'s not very comfortable and whatever the material is, I hate the feel of it, it\'s like it\'s slick and my plams just want to slide off of it and I feel like my palms will get sweaty from laying aginat this all day.We\'ll see afte a little more use, I just don\'t know yet, so I\'ll give it a 3. I want my G710+ back! The only thing about that is the keys tend to break and it was impossible to keep it clean the way there so many crevices and space under the keys for dust to hide in.Anyway, this is funny. I went and got the palm wrest off my G710+ and the tabs on it fit right under this keyboard and I can move it around the desk without it even moving! So I\'m keeping it, the feel is so much better than the magnetic thing they sent. I like the feel of the plastic so much better than whatever that material is.Also, I cannot type as fast on thie keyboard as I could the G710+. I hink because it\'s smaller, more compact and I don\'t have tiny hands and fingers. And maybe because I\'m just not used to it, but I think it\'s because it\'s smaller.','2021-12-19 23:16:55',3,6,210),(497,'  Pros:- quietest keyboard in existence- has number pad (good for work)- quick, customizable, and elegant- disable the windows key and it has on-board memory to remember my preferences after rebootCons:- not tactile (no physical feedback for button presses... you have taken this for granted without realizing it)- has number pad (bad for mouse-heavy gaming)- lack of OLED display applications (due to price premium; seriously steelseries if you want this to catch on you need to integrate these into cheaper models of your keyboards)- profile switch + macro record button are not remappable (fixed functions)verdict: Don\'t buy this for the OLED display, it\'s near useless. Despite this, I believe that the switches are absolutely next generation. I can only hope that they release these switches, boards, and SDK for hobbyists so I can make a version with a better display/ expanded function and programmability. With absolute certainty, I can say that steelseries is working on a new version of this keyboard (likely with an upgraded or touch display).

I go this primarily for its backlit keys.  I don\'t really understand why gamers needs such a pretty keyboard.  I think maybe some keys have special purposes for gaming and so are similarly colored.  On my keyboard for e.g. keys ASDW, up, down, left, right are colored differently from all the other keys - purple.  The number keys on the number pad are yellow, the operators red, the number keys on the main keyboard are red, the other letters turquoise(? one of those light blues) and the function keys are a bright blue, the home, ins, pg up etc. are green.  There are various effects for the lighting which I really dont get the purpose of.I like that there is an indicator for caps lock, and num lock and also a windows lock key.  Not sure what it does.There is a lot of play when pressing the keys.  You don\'t have to press hard but here is also space between the keys so it feels like you will press more than one key at a time but its surprisingly accurate.  The body feels good.  It sits a little high off the table surface as compared to my logitech wireless keyboard.  So I\'m not happy about that.  It forces my wrists up - I like my keyboard as flat as possible.Its not particularly noisy either.  I was expecting a loud clickety-clack-clack but not really.  My other option was to get one of those membrane keyboards and I am not a fan of them.  Dont like the feel.Thankfully the lights turn of when your PC sleeps.  Otherwise I imagine this could light up a dark room.Docking a star because I cant find a mode where all the keys are lit up the same color.  Why not man?  All these weird strobing and running and flashing effects but no ability to have just one solid color.

That\'s pretty!\"Much Rainbow.I really liked the magnetic wrist rest and look of the keyboard, I\'m just more accustomed to certain bells and whistles this one doesn\'t come with.

The LEDs are really nice and work well. They have a lot of different settings and the brightness is adjustable. That part is great. The keys are the problem. The problem is that the design of the keys is like a square as opposed to a standard beveled key. This throws your tactile sense off and you can easily hit several keys when typing fast. That makes it VERY difficult to type quickly. I work and play games on my PC and I was making a ton of mistakes using this keyboard. Using the WASD was not possible and I just had to order a different one. I will give this one to my 6 YO son who loves the LEDs. It\'s possible you can buy a different set of keys for this thing. It does come with a key puller. Who knows. That\'s my experience with this keyboard though.','2021-12-19 23:16:50',3,3,219),(511,'  Second time trying a mechanical keyboard. I don\'t get the hype still and this wasn\'t the product to change my mind. It\'s an OK product but not really my thing.Some good things about this keyboard:- Feels like the quality is good, I believe it will last a long time. However it\'s hard to say because it\'s the first day having it.- I like the key shape, the rounded corners are nice and the keys are slightly concave from all 4 sides, but not too heavily. I tend to prefer flat keys, but these are pretty comfy.- It does have a cool aesthetic appearance. Kind of like those Retro Diners that have chrome trim everywhere.Some things I don\'t like:- As with all mechanical keyboards, the keys are huge in the vertical axis. I prefer doing everything with a chiclet keyboard and I will be going back to a chiclet keyboard soon, just going to leave this as a backup.- Even though these are not clicky switches, they\'re still pretty loud. You can hear the springs as you type and each keycap has quite a bit of \"wiggle\" so the keycaps themselves make a lot of noise when your fingers strike them.- To me, typing feels a bit awkward because the keys have a lot of travel, but the activation point is close to the top of the travel. I\'d say the activation point is somewhere around 2 mm, while I believe the keys bottom out at what feels like well over 5 mm. I don\'t have any way to measure it but to me this is an awkward combination for typing. Also makes it quite easy to accidentally press the wrong key while typing.- The color of the lighting is set for each key, you can\'t change it. There are different animated \"patterns\" but each individual key only has one color that\'s either on or off.','2021-12-19 23:16:51',3,2,219),(512,'  I bought one of these keyboards on December 14th 2020. I initially loved it so much that I purchased another on December 30th 2020. It\'s now March of 2021 and both of my keyboards are a complete mess.The first keyboard got a bit sticky on a key so we tried taking it apart to clean. The pieces are so hard to put back together that we\'ve given up on that keyboard.The second keyboard was used heavily for gaming. Several keys, especially my spacebar, make an insanely loud squeaky spring noise when pressed. ITS ONLY BEEN A FEW MONTHS OF USE!!! My initial impression of this being a quality keyboard are gone.

I noticed the X, S and W keys started to fail in that order.  I went out of my way to be gentle with this keyboard and to keep it clean after my last keyboard of almost 8 years finally died.

It has a slew of lighting options and splashy patterns including a completely \"off\" lighting selection. For the price is about as good as it gets.

I had to put something on one of the legs to stabilize it which is why i gave it 4 stars. It works perfectly now. I especially love the quick volume control.','2021-12-19 23:16:57',4,8,219),(518,'  If you don\'t have a Asus setup and just want a high quality keyboard for gaming, I would probably go with the Corsair K95 Platinum. However, if you are like me and want to match the rest of your hardware, this isn\'t a bad choice.The lighting, if you are into that kind of thing, is really good. Several choices on lighting effects, however I stick with \"static\". Build quality is pretty good and it feels solid. One thing I have a problem with is the lack of bumps to find the S key when gaming. It\'s marketed as a gaming keyboard but the only location bumps on the key caps are on the F and J keys which are the standards for finding \'home row\' when typing. They need to add a \'bump\' on the S key so you can more easily locate WASD while gaming. In addition, the wrist rest doesn\'t really snap to the keyboard and if you pick it up to move it, it\'s going to fall off. Not a big deal to most people I would imagine, but worth a mention.I wish this keyboard had a row of macro assigned keys like the K95, but Asus kept the keyboard smaller by not adding them. Maybe not enough people use this, I\'m not sure. This keyboard does not come with a key cap puller for easy cleaning. This is something that the K95 comes with and is the kind of attention to detail that Asus all too often miss with their peripherals (Claymore wrist rest anyone?). For the premium price, I expect attention to detail and perks.As of right now the biggest miss for me is the software, I did not change my rating based on the software, as this is supposed to be a review of the keyboard, and to me, the keyboard is a 4 out of 5. The software would probably be a 2 or 3 out of 5. There is a lot of room for improvement. Right now if you want to enabled a profile for a particular game, i.e. changing certain important key cap colors such as WASD, etc, that can be done by linking the profile to a exe. The problem is, as far as I know, there is no easy way to switch back to a default profile once you shut the game down. Because of this, you have to open Armoury II and manually click back to your default profile. How that hasn\'t been addressed at this point I\'m not sure.To sum up, solid keyboard missing some details and perks you\'d expect for the amount of money you pay. Software needs improvement as it\'s not good enough yet.','2021-12-19 23:16:58',4,10,220),(519,'  My last two keyboards have been Corsair boards (K55 and K70 Rapidfire). I had significant software and firmware issues with these boards, including but not limited to infinite key ghosting, randomly disconnecting every connected USB device, and causing lockups when connecting and disconnecting controllers and similar devices. I also hated the Cherry MX Speed switches I had on the K70, too little actuation force and distance, far too linear, and typing felt really mushy (would also hit lots of other keys because of how odd the Speed switches are). And for a $150 keyboard, the K70 was definitely not worth it (doesn\'t even have on board memory!). Not to mention, the iCUE software is very bad. You can do a lot of cool lighting effects with it, but the UI is ugly and it is very clunky. Some things like profile switching and adding macros to new profiles is very annoying and is really time consuming (often times profiles would randomly switch on their own when tabbing through various open programs).Queue the ROG Strix Flare. After being pissed at how bad my last few keyboards were I definitely didn\'t want to get another Corsair one. I\'ve been a fan of Asus products for some time, with most of my PC being made out of ROG components and having a Zenfone; so I naturally went to see what Asus had to offer. The Claymore looks really nice, but its quite expensive and doesn\'t come with a wrist rest (from what I\'ve seen), so I looked for other options. The Cerberus is a membrane board, and isn\'t RGB; but its cheap. I saw the Flare crop up in Amazon and it looked pretty good. I went and watched a couple reviews for it and was sold. I chose the MX Brown model.Unboxing the Strix Flare was really nice. The keyboard was wrapped in cloth and, as per usual, the actual box itself was well designed and very simplistic. I went and got the ROG Armoury II software; which has less customization than Corsair\'s, but the UI is nicer and works far better. The Brown switches were immediately different from the Speed switches. I can rest my hand on the keys without accidentally inputting a bunch of random characters, and the feel of pressing the key is much more responsive thanks to the tactile bump. The heavier actuation force and farther actuation distance makes typing much more enjoyable. I no longer accidentally press wrong or extra keys, and the keycaps feel nicer under my fingers.The board itself looks more simplistic than the K70, and it feels nicer despite being made out of plastic. The RGB elements are done better imo, and the under-glow on the sides is cool. The media keys are easier to reach because they aren\'t hidden behind tall keycaps anymore, I would prefer them to be above the numpad, but I think the trade-off is acceptable. The volume nob is larger and feels better when you roll it. There is no volume mute button, which is kind of unfortunate, but at least there\'s media keys. I don\'t feel like the Windows lock button is necessary, but I\'ve rarely used them before, so maybe its nice for someone else. Actually having on-the-fly macro recording is nice as well (if it was on the K70 I never knew how to use it). The wrist rest feels nice, despite not being padded. However I think they cut back here, the wrist rest does not seem to actually attach to the board, not even with magnets. I just seems to kinda rest in the grooves cutout for the wrist rest, if you lift the keyboard the wrist rest will fall off.ROG Armoury II, the software used to control ROG peripherals is really nice. Macros are universal across lighting profiles (I absolutely love this). The Flare has onboard storage, which I expect at this pricepoint, and is nice (no more mismatched RGB while booting up). This also means I don\'t have to install software and copy files over to a DVD or USB drive just to use the keyboard on my laptop, or another PC. The Flare also has built in profile switching buttons (thank you) and you don\'t have to unplug the keyboard to factory reset (also a nice touch, I think).There are probably better keyboards for less, but I prefer Asus products and I don\'t think it was money poorly spent. I\'m loving this keyboard and I highly recommend it for those who like MX Brown (or similar) switches and want a nice, high quality RGB mechanical keyboard.','2021-12-19 23:16:59',5,8,220),(520,'  Razer now has competition.Let me say prior to anything else that I keep my devices clean and don\'t smoke or spill liquids or have any other habits that could cause damage. I clean my keyboards roughly once every three or four weeks and do my best to keep them in good shape.That said, I\'ve previously owned four razer blackwidow keyboards, so I know darn well what a bad keyboard is like, and I must say I\'m VERY impressed by ASUS with this one.I have purchased two of this specific ROG Strix keyboard with the brown switches in the last five months, each lasting about two before keys will stop registering or responding (which is dangerously similar to razer\'s products). Prior to these critical malfunctions, it\'s not rare that I need to restart the armory software or unplug the keyboard and put it back in to get the lights going. I have yet to see armory crash, though, so that already makes it better than razer. However, with approximately the same span of time before things start to act up, it\'s not a lengthy superiority. As a matter of fact, even despite poor functionality and lifespan, this board has fewer customization options than razer. FAR fewer. To make it worse, macro usage in the armory doesn\'t register as macros in any programs. It comes through as a simple one-key input, no matter how you mess with the options.At that, the only thing that makes this board worth any more than what you could get from razer is mere preference of company. Personally, I favor ASUS because there\'s less support for blizzard and their logo is respectable, along with the fact that ASUS does make other peripherals that work phenomenally well (not to mention their even more superior components). Sorry, razer. Only one other competitor in this race, and you still lose.Given that I\'ve used a Corsair keyboard for six months with ONE software-restarting issue to occur more than two months into its time of use (which, again, is the approximate lifespan of this board) before selling it to make money for one of these, the brand of choice is quite clear.I love you, ASUS, but garbage is garbage. This is garbage.','2020-09-10 03:00:00',1,20,220),(521,'  I\'m just going to shoot this straight: I don\'t think I can ever go back now. I bought the ROG STRIX Cherry MX Blue version of this keyboard, and it\'s a completely different beast compared to the terrible (my opinion) actuation of the MX Speed/Silver/Red switches. I get full actuation, and I love the overall layout. The USB pass-through, along with volume control, were two big selling points, but the MX Blues make this keyboard my favorite, hands down. The RGB lighting is bright enough that I can see in pitch black, and the overall quality of the board makes it feel sturdy, with added life & longevity.I very much enjoyed the stock key caps on mine, but I really wanted to give PBT keys a try. If you do decide to grab this board, and you should, I would suggest upgraded to some sort of PBT key cap, specifically pudding key caps. You won\'t regret the added bonus of quality + durability.10/10! Never owned a ROG STRIX product before this, but I\'m sold on quality if this is where it leads!','2021-07-30 04:00:00',5,16,220),(522,'  This keyboard has more weight than I thought, this is my first mechanical keyboard. It\'s different, the keys are very sensitive and loud, but it\'s a mechanical keyboard of course it\'s loud. It takes a while to get used to, I\'m so used to using this keyboard, now my laptops keyboard feels like garbage compared to this, it\'s so stiff. The RGB lights are nice, it matches my computer, I use Asus aura sync most of the time it\'s blue, not RGB. Overall it\'s well built, it feels nice, it needs an update through ROG armory before use. Don\'t buy it you are using corsair lights in your PC, corsair uses didn\'t software (just an FYI for anyone who wants to have RGB lights that sync together). I used all Asus aura compatible products and I like it.','2021-12-19 23:16:54',5,19,220),(523,'  I\'m picky about my keyboards, and it took a long time to find one that I like.I\'ve owned this keyboard for a little while now (first phase of my new computer set up). In the time that I\'ve had it, I only have one major complaint about it, and it\'s not even the keyboard itself. It\'s the software. Asus Armory is a little finicky and a lot of the times bugs out, but I\'m not letting that sway my opinion on the keyboard since it has presets that work just fine (so you can avoid the more convoluted software and color customization if you don\'t feel like fighting with it) .I\'ll start with the overall quality of the keyboard. It\'s sturdy, doesn\'t flex at all (unless you want to practice your chest compressions on it). The fact the the border keys are the lighter pink while the inside is a grey color is very nice for the main reason of cleanliness. The pink gets filthy, even with regular cleaning and wiping down. It\'s a light color, so what else is there to expect? The Matching mouse mat also gets rather dirty, but weekly washing makes that better.The extent of customization for the back lighting is amazing. I tend to have fun with the custom colors and I even have specific WASD profiles for different games. The bar for volume (or would it be a dial?) is lovely for small adjustments. I wish there was a separate mute button instead of pressing on the dial, but that\'s just a small personal issue.The wrap this up, because this was my first purchase towards my entire new set up [roughly a $3.2k computer], I am beyond ecstatic to say I\'ve been purchasing more Asus products. The quality is great, customer service fantastic, and I can customize and personalize to my heart\'s content. Thank you, Asus <3','2019-11-18 14:15:00',5,17,220),(524,'  I only just received my delivery and set it up, so I will adjust thi review accordingly if the need arises. I can say without a doubt this keyboard feels the best out of all of them that I have used in the past. I decided to give the recent release Roccat Vulcan a try and started having double type issues within a month, so I decide to switch to this, and it is beyond comparison how much better this one feels. The Roccat wasn\'t bad that typing issue aside, but to say I preferred that over this would be a lie. This keyboard does feel like it is a little bit high and I am hoping it doesn\'t cause tiredness in my wrist, but we\'ll see. Again, take this with a grain of salt since I haven\'t actually used it much yet, but initial use is great.','2021-12-05 15:29:15',5,7,220),(525,'  This keyboard is great. At first we were hesitant to buy it because it was so expensive and we didn\'t understand why. Other than the aura sync feature, it didn\'t make sense to be that much. We understood once we opened the box and plugged it in. Not only is it a very solid keyboard, made out of good materials... It syncs with Aura, meaning all of our lights are matching each other. This keyboard looks great, feels great, and has a bunch of customizable options available. It comes with some spare parts, I don\'t know what they\'re called to let you know what spare parts they come with, but just know that there are some.The downfall to this keyboard is that it is massive in size. At least compared to our cheap keyboard that we had before, that was not a gamer keyboard. If you\'re building your first gamer PC, keep in mind that the keyboard is going to be a lot bigger, therefore requiring a bigger desk. We bought a desk from Amazon a few weeks prior to buying this keyboard, only to find out that it didn\'t fit on the computer desk. pretty crappy when you\'ve already assembled the desk and you can\'t return it anymore, right? Either way, we made it work but I wish we would have put that into consideration before buying the desk because I would have picked something else. You have the option to remove the additional palm holder. Again, I don\'t know the terminology... But the piece at the bottom of the keyboard where you rest your palm, that piece can be removed. Although, I don\'t recommend it because it is very comfortable.Bottom line is, this is a solid keyboard and in my opinion it is worth the money it\'s being sold for. If you want the best, go with this one.','2017-08-09 09:00:00',5,3,220),(526,'  So, this keyboard I\'ve had for over a year now, and I absolutely love it. Click and clack\'s have stayed true and they keys have gotten a bit worn out, but nothing that a bit of cleaning won\'t fix. RGB software is absolutely bad, if you use their old ASUS Aura and ROG armory applications, they actually do wonders for the keyboard. Though use the new Armory II software to update the keyboards software (really important).THE FATAL FLAW: If you are booting your PC up, and Windows or Linux has not popped up yet, DO NOT CLICK THE BRIGHTNESS HOTKEY ON THE TOP OF THE KEYBOARD NXET TO THE WINDOWS LOCK BUTTON. It will brick your keyboard. If you ask Asus to help fix it, they will ask for a 30-35 dollar charge into looking into it. This is not stated anywhere, but KEEP IT IN MIND. Don\'t click on boot up. Asus support said to update the keyboards firmware as it \"addresses\" the problem, but I could not get them to say that it \"fixes\" the problem. Which means that the bug is probably still there. EVGA came out with a new keyboard recently and for my next one,  I may be looking towards there. That bug is just so bad. And it exists in all of the models except for the COD one I believe, in which they had patched it there. I got lucky and Amazon support helped me out and get it replaced, but don\'t bet on it. If you\'re okay with that problem, it\'s a damn good keyboard otherwise! Just sucks when you aren\'t warned about such a terrible problem.','2021-03-14 17:00:00',3,15,220),(527,'            Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n        \n\n\n   I\'m absolutely in love with this keyboard. A little pricy but I was willing to pay more because it had everything I wanted. The color and LEDs are beautiful. I love that you can customize the logo although I have yet to actually do it. Haven\'t found time. I also love that this keyboard has a numpad and media keys. The scroll wheel is smooth and not clicky. The keyboard itself is everything I wanted and I adore it.However, I must note that the gray keys are much darker in person than they are pictured. Not a huge deal to me in the slightest and can always get new keycaps. Just wanted to note in case it\'s a bother for anyone else.The software is rather annoying. I spent forever even trying to find it online. Half the time it shuts down as soon as I try to open the app. However, when it does work, you can use presets and also create your own. These are set up on different profiles and as long as you have what you what set on a profile, you can switch between them without having to open the software which is helpful.One last thing is that the hand rest is hard and not soft. I\'ve had the keyboard for months and it has never bothered me although it may not be everyone\'s cup of tea. However, it is detachable! You don\'t need to use it.All of this being said, none of these bother me which is why I give 5 stars. Only stating for others\' benefits. I\'m in love with this keyboard and couldn\'t imagine having any other.','2021-01-05 23:30:00',5,9,220),(528,'            Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n        \n\n\n   To start I just want to note that this keyboard has all the features I was looking for as not a lot of boards out there have good features and are still tkl (I don’t like full or 6065%).I’ve had many keyboards as I’m a bit of a fanatic. This one however has some of the worst ping I’ve ever heard on a keyboard let alone a thin metal top plated tkl. I have no idea why it’s so bad but just watch the video I attached and turn up the volume. It sounds like your typing on a foot-long garage door spring lol. Compare it to something like a g915 tkl which is almost identical in form factor and it’s night and day difference.Anyone that has used or tried to use the razer huntsman te knows that the V1 optical red switches were terrible for typing on that. Well these are almost identical the weight of both these switches is way too light and the actuation was way too quick at just one millimeter on the razer and feels almost the same on this. Though the specs on these switches on the Vulcan TKL are not the same they as I said feel almost identical when you type on them the switches are too light and they actuate far too easily creating many typos. I’m sure they would be fine in game but I’m not a fan of actuations when resting my fingers on the keys.Which brings me to my next point. The key caps on this keyboard are spray-painted black ABS and probably the cheapest thinnest things I’ve seen on any keyboard I’ve ever had. Absolutely terrible. I tried the razor PBT key caps on it which fit but felt very strange bottoming out due to the switch design. I also tried the hyper X pudding key caps they felt the same way and given the performance and the sound I didn’t even bother trying to install the software. I returned mine.That’s said, I love the detachable USB-C. The form factor. The lighting isn’t the greatest even though you’d think it would be which is strange. The volume and mute are great. If you haven’t used a mechanical keyboard before you might be able to stomach this but even typing on it I lost track of what I was typing due to how loud the ping is (not the switch but the ringing sound after hitting a key).I wanted to love it but it was a no from me. On a side note it’s fairly obvious the vine reviews on this have no idea what they are talking about which is why I’m writing this as those are so incredibly off base.','2021-12-19 23:16:49',1,7,221),(529,'  I decided to get a TKL keyboard for my setup since i already own a G915 tactical and a NK65 V2 aluminum. I wanted to get another mechanical so I decided to pre-order a tkl pro. This keyboard uses their titan optical key switches but they remind me of linear red switches. I have never used such a loud linear switch before. Part of the blame is the key travel seems crazy long but i also think the short keycaps cause my expectations to be similar to the low-profile g915 which it is not! I was able to mitigate the issue by using o-rings/dampeners on the keycaps giving me a nice shorter stroke and less noise if I bottom out, but this did not fix the \"thunk\" when the cap moves back upwards so it is still loud and i hope break-in fixes this somewhat.The keycaps are oil magnets btw and to me they feel flimsy, slippery, and cheap (abs). The keycap is relatively small and cuts out part of the normal bottom, but I am not sure if I like this design as they make pudding keycaps to give more lighting if that is what they are trying to do.The switches are mounted directly onto the keyboard\'s top panel which is nice for cleaning. The media controls are also the f9-f12 keys, but you can semi-permanently switch them with fn+del (turns the del key white to show it is switched/active). There is also a dedicated mute button and volume control both of which I do not believe you can re-map.Overall I\'m not sure why the vulcan tkl pro is so expensive. I wish it came with a magnetic wrist rest for the price like their full-size version, but my wood glorious wrist rest (TKL size) fits perfect. I am not sure if i would purchase a roccat product again as I don\'t believe there is much value for the money and that is saying a lot as a g915 owner.Edit: i decided to throw on some pbs doubleshot alpherior keys i had laying around, and the difference is huge! no more slippery buttons! I\'d highly suggest getting new keycaps, all though i kept the original F9-F12 since they are also the media buttons and i also kept INS, HOME, PG-UP, PG-DOWN, DEL, END and the arrow keys and the ctrl key.','2021-12-19 23:16:50',3,2,221),(530,'  I really wanted to like this keyboard, in pictures it really looks great.  Setup was easy, and looked great on my desk.  (sound bar is weird, not sure why manufactures think that is a good idea)My problem was that it was not a silent keyboard.  Much louder then I was looking for, I had hoped the new switches would really cut down the sound and they did not.Second issue that I had was the gaps between the keys.  I didn\'t realize but when gaming my fingers float close to the keyboard and with this keyboard would catch myself in the gaps between the keys.  Turns out for me a keyboard deck is something I really need.So back to my Logitech k740.','2021-12-19 23:16:51',2,13,221),(531,'  Unless you are thinking about switching out your keyboard every time you want to do anything OTHER than gaming, don\'t buy this keyboard. The short travel cause too many accidental keystrokes. Actually even during gaming I find myself hitting E when I am trying to reload (R).Fine, perhaps that is just me and my typing habits aren\'t conducive to a perfect user experience when it comes to this keyboard.Here is the other problem I ran into. One of my keys (;) randomly (or I just have never noticed) became sticky. No i have not spilled anything on it or had food on it nor did I touch the keyboard with dirty hands. I could not figure out how to clean it besides taking it all apart. Now this was where this keyboard really pissed me off. (or the a-hole of a design team, rather) They put a screw underneath the rubber feet. I suppose they were not planning for this keyboard to be user serviceable or cleanable.So, I opened the damn thing up and found some residue on the back of the PCB (not somewhere I could dirty). I think that was what contributed to the sticky key. By the way, I couldn\'t find any repair guide online but you CAN remove the clear cap from the back by pushing in the tabs from either side which will allow you to gain access to the spring, rail and the cylinder...Anyways, since this keyboard is my first and last mechanical keyboard, I\'m going to try to make it last (for the pretty penny I\'ve paid). Not sure if lubing up a keyboard is something that ALL mechanical keyboard users find themselves doing... Suppose I am learning.Quick Summery:The lighting - boring without having to install the program. I\'ve never found RGB to be an important part of the computing/gaming experience. Sure as F wasn\'t about to make it a fashion statement. This keyboard did NOT change my mind.Noise - Well, there are no quiet long-travel keyboards (not to my knowledge. I thought at least with optical switches I\'d abstain myself from the narcissistic clickery and spare the ears of whoever is on the other end of the voice call. Frankly my computer is also located in my acoustically treated studio. There is just no getting away from the plastic on plastic auditory fckery.Macro - Nah, not flexible enough. HEY rotary encodes are cool but not when they are limited to ONE purpose. Get creative dev team.Cool factor - Besides the occasional reconciliation brought on by my non-computer oriented friends \"wow you have one of those light up keyboards?!\" I\'ve found myself drowning in self loathing for having bought into this idiotic trend of self indulgence. No. This keyboard will not make you cooler. Not if you are honest with yourself.Ergonomic - Coming from a shitty HP low profile keyboard, I\'ve found myself needing to buy a wrist rest with how high this keyboard forces you to bend your wrist. Don\'t want carpal tunnel? Get a thinner keyboard. Never had numbness with my HP keyboard until I switched.I regret my purchase but obviously your mileage will very. May luck be in your favour.','2021-12-19 23:16:52',2,20,221),(532,'  Originally, I was a bit unimpressed with the keyboard but figured I would just stick with it as overall build seemed solid. As time has gone on it has deteriorated in two key areas. First, the keystroke feel went from slightly better than rubber dome to zero feedback where I just have to hard bottom every key to be confident of my keystroke. I have had to slow down my typing speed to ensure I am hitting each key. The other area is the keycaps have started to flake apart where whatever material they coated the keys with is flaking away from use (see photo).At this point I plan to just toss new keycaps on it and give it to the kids to use on their computer and get a WASD code (backlight helps when I am in programs with wonky shortcuts in a dark room).Pros:Build quality on the baseplate is solidVery easy to cleanMagnetic wrist-rest is coolRGB if you like thatCons:It isn\'t actually a good typing keyboardPriced way too high for the typing experience it offersSeems to wear faster than most other known brands I have usedKeycaps are garbageTLDR: You can get more for less from better brands with tried and true switches.','2021-12-19 23:16:53',2,17,221),(533,'  I\'ve had plenty of keyboards before of all kinds including with laptops included. This keyboard definitely has a custom click to it but it is a nice click for sure! I do like how each key sounds, enter, backspace are especially nice. Not sure what the above reviewers are talking about with some kind of ringing to the click, I hear none of that. That would be way too particular for me though so it\'s not even a thing. I\'m a software engineer so I do type quite fast.This is the first time I\'ve tried a TKL board for home use but I don\'t use the other pad that often so we\'ll try it because the compact size is welcome! I also enjoy the lighting schemes especially the main intelligent typing one that lights the keys up as you type with more emphasis on ones held longer or pushed more while change colors throughout. It\'s kinda like a heat map almost.Beautiful keyboard for sure and I can tell that the quickness is pretty snappy. Not sure how to gauge the value/money ratio but I didn\'t buy this for value or money, I bought this for premium and coolness first then functionality for the money second.','2021-12-19 23:16:54',5,11,221),(534,'  So, I got this to be primarily a gaming keyboard. I paid special attention to typing reviews because even while gaming typing is sometimes required. I was looking for an all-rounder but with a stronger focus on gaming... I also wanted it to be able to resist a splash of water (that\'s how I lost my previous keyboard and why I needed this one). The volume knob is quite pleasant to use and the minimal profile really does it for me. I did find the keycaps to be unusual at first, but it\'s actually fantastic. I tried swapping keycaps and it made the board sound less crisp, plus the space between the caps allows for amazing RGB and easier typing (less likely to hit adjacent keys). Pretty rare to find a great gaming keyboard that also does well for typing. Bottom line... this competes with these new extremely expensive premiums boards and does it just as good or better in all areas (assuming you don\'t absolutely need adjustable actuation switches for some reason). I definitely think this is the best priced mechanical gaming board right now. If only they had this in a 65% layout for a few bucks cheaper.The one thing I was worried about was the reports of spring ping and unpleasant case noise. Well, I can tell you the spring pingy-ness is pretty minimal. The only thing I heard was the mildly rattley stabilizers (which are much better than most pre-build gaming boards). However, I detest any noticable rattle in my spacebar sooo... I modded them (have to open the case which I assume voids any warranty) with some krytox 205g0 and added a little bit of foam. With optical switches no soldering is required to fully disassemble this keyboard. I would only recommend doing a mod on this board if you have some experience with board modding, as the keycaps are very delicate and the stabs are non-standard so if something gets broken you\'ll have a useless unreturnable board.','2021-12-19 23:16:55',5,15,221),(535,'  This keyboard has some awesome features.  This is by far the most I\'ve ever paid for a keyboard. Having the volume know on the top right was a pretty neat feature that I didn\'t even read about. I enjoy gaming in my free time, when I get free time.  I\'ve had this key oa4d for roughly a month to month and a half, I dont get to game terribly often.  But within this short time, my w key, which in most games is the forward button, has begun to have this rubbing sort of sound when the key is depressed. I\'ve attempted to blow it out in case dust has collected.  At this point I\'m unsure of what\'s causing the noise, but it is annoying and disappointing. I attempted to venture away from razer, and this is proving to be a mistake.  It\'s pretty cool that you can change lighting affects and such, but for me. The operational ability of the keyboard is of utmost importance.  Now I\'ll have to live with this annoying sound until I feel like spending money to replace this nearly brand new keyboard.10-18-21I have to drop the rating even further, This keyboard barely lasted me 3 months and worked OK in that time.  Eventually keys became unresponsive.  I\'ve had to replace it, it was a complete waste of money.Purchased May 4 2021, stopped using early september.','2021-12-19 23:16:56',1,5,221),(536,'  Wonderful keyboard, switch feel is great and profile is flat like a g915 but with a slightly higher height that is somewhere in between a 915 and a ducky one mini. The keycaps will be a sticking point for some as they are not pbt but I work in healthcare and my hands are typically super dry so these provide more grip that is in between a traditional abs and pbt cap. Switch feel is wonderful as well, and at least on par with razr and steel series optical switches but they feel the most like a cherry red out of any that I have used. Overall it’s a wonderful keyboard and I almost forgot to mention build quality seems good as well for the price, not all plastic like a ducky and not all aluminum like a drop, which makes sense since it’s priced smack in the middle of those two.','2021-12-19 23:16:57',5,9,221),(537,'  I\'ve never written a review for a product on the same day as receiving it, but I was so impressed with this keyboard I immediately bought a second for my nephew and I\'m ready to slam a 5-star.This is my first experience with linear actuation or optical switches. I\'ve heard people say this board does a pretty good job with typing -- so that it\'s useful for beyond just gaming -- and let me just say, that holds true. I\'m quite a speedy touch typist (120+ wpm), and I can type as fast as ever with only minimal errors, which should only improve with some more time on the board. I saw some say this keyboard is loud, but it isn\'t really. I suspect this is from people bottoming out on their key strokes, but if you\'re a more skilled typist you will learn the actuation point and type much lighter and quieter since the linear switches don\'t require you to bottom out your presses.When it comes to gaming, wow, what a difference. The smooth strokes and quick response feels like it has lifted the skill ceiling on movement. I can actually dance around with my hand on the keyboard much faster to do the things I want to do, and I feel much more precise. I did not expect a keyboard to make such a big difference, but if you are being bottlenecked on a slower board, then this definitely will make a difference for you as it has for me.The weight of the board is really solid and the key presses are super soft. The RGB looks great and you can assign different lighting to individual keys in the software.Only one gripe so far: ABS keycaps.For a $140 board it would be nice to have PBT, but I knew this when I got it. Still, the finish on the keys is actually very nice and feels much better than your typical ABS caps.The tldr of all this -- amazing for gaming, yet still solid for typing. Super comfy to type on and feels quality.','2021-12-19 23:16:58',5,5,221),(538,'  I didn\'t buy this for gaming - just for normal daily work as I type a lot and wanted a better keyboard. The quality is obvious and I expect it will last for many years. The key action is very crisp, they\'re slightly indented so they have a good feel around your finger, and the plastic is nice to touch. All great things.For people that are interested in all sorts of different color schemes, I\'m sure they can get whatever they want - there are many built in options and then also the ability to fully customize.All of that said, I nearly packed the keyboard up and sent it back right (hence the 4 stars). The keyboard worked without the Swarm software, but there was no way to turn off the colors - only dim them or turn off the lighting completely. Without back-lighting, it would be very difficult to see the key caps so that\'s really not an option.After downloading Swarm and starting the installation, some Microsoft components had to be installed on my 64-win Win10 machine. That\'s fine, but then my PC hard rebooted without warning. After the reboot, nothing appeared installed so I started the process again. This time it went straight the Swarm software (so the MSFT components evidently completed), and that appeared to install without a problem, but then after starting Swarm the only option was to do a software update - and I had just downloaded the LATEST software available from their website!?Swarm didn\'t give me any real options other than to update again, but when I did that it appeared to hang and after about 5 minutes I killed the app. I tried to reinstall - ended up de-installing everything and then reinstalling everything again. Once again I was given the only choice of updating. As this caused a problem before, I went on-line looking for a manual or any information - there isn\'t one as far as I can tell, and there wasn\'t any information in the box other than to install Swarm!With nowhere else to go, I went ahead and updated my software once again, and once again the app appeared to hang. Fortunately I was called away for about 45 minutes as when I came back, the keyboard lights were off, I couldn\'t use it to log back in, and there were four white lights blinking on the bottom right of the keyboard. With no way to log in, I unplugged the USB, plugged it back in, and then the keyboard started back up and I was able to login.The screen in front of me had instructions to unplug and plug the keyboard back in as it had done a firmware upgrade! Unannounced. With no explanation. With no manual. With no help options discussing this.Roccat - in case it isn\'t abundantly clear, it is unacceptable to do a silent firmware upgrade! Please put some instructions up on your website - but that\'s the backup plan Swarm itself should tell users what it\'s doing and give a rough estimate of how long it will take. Had you done that, other than MSFT\'s hard reboot, installing the keyboard would have been a breeze.P.S. I\'ve enjoyed writing this review. The keys really do feel great and I believe I type faster on it.','2021-12-19 23:16:59',4,18,222),(539,'  I\'m not concerned at all with RGB features, and actually find them a bit off-putting and tacky. I bought this solely on the basis of the reviews of the keys and build quality. Admittedly I do love the feel of the keys, and it is a beautiful looking keyboard. However, it does have a few shortcomings and the absence of some common features seem like a bit of a missed opportunity....First off, the images make it look like it\'s built like a tank, with the lovely brushed aluminium top - however, it still has a bit of flex that I was not expecting. The hand rest attaches magnetically which is a nice touch, but it\'s very hard and not at all comfortable. The dedicated media keys are inadequate. I don\'t want to have to hit shortcuts to play/pause music. The volume control is nice but at a minimum I would expect dedicated skip, stop, play/pause buttons, in addition to the mute button. Pretty much standard on other \'premium\' keyboards. I\'m a huge fan of macro keys, but Macro keys via multi-key press shortcuts is completely pointless in my opinion. I use macro keys heavily on my other keyboards because I program them to replace otherwise additional key presses. I\'ll never use what they have attempted to implement here. Finally, they really should have included a USB port. Even if they couldn\'t make it a pass-thru type, I\'d happily deal with an extra connector at the end of the cable to get this feature.Overall, it is a very nicely presented keyboard and the keys are top notch. Unless a \'unicorn\' solution comes along, I have no intention of replacing the AIMO despite the absence of the features mentioned above. If you are in to all the RGB stuff, this has customizable features by the boatload and you will probably get more out of it than I do in that regard.So in summary, five stars for appearance and key quality, less one star for poor implementation of some features (media keys, macro functionality, hand rest) and for the missing USB port... and finally, less one more star for the price, which in my opinion is too high given the aforementioned flaws','2020-09-10 03:00:00',3,6,222),(540,'  Notes:- The RGB effects are very, very cool, completely love the design. The Roccat Swarm software used to control it also works as intended. Roccat swarm software can also be used to make macros and reassign keys. Nice.- About the RBG , one thing that bothers me slightly is that the intelligent lighting has a significant delay between keypress and light (approx 0.5 seconds, sometimes more. Just feels a little bit sluggish)- The titan switches feel very good. They are not loud at all but have a very nice mechanical actuation- The letters on the keys are not painted but rather they are spaces in the opaque layer where the LED lighting shines through. This makes it impossible to scratch off the letters, but also makes the letters not visible when the LEDs are turned off.- There is a knob on the top right for controlling both RGB brightness and volume. There\'s also a mute button. Both are very handy- The individual keys have larger than normal spaces in-between them. This requires a little bit of a learning curve. In the beginning my fingers were tripping over the edges of the keys. After a bit of practice I found myself liking the spaces more than I thought I would--it encourages better typing accuracy and actually feels more satisfying (maybe it\'s just me?)- Full size keyboard. I WISH they had a numpad-less version!Overall, incredible keyboard. A+. Recommend. Yay Roccat!','2021-07-30 04:00:00',5,12,222),(541,'            Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n        \n\n\n   I needed a high quality and \"all around\" keyboard both for productivity as well as gaming. I believe that you can have both but it\'s very hard to find something that can do both well especially at an affordable price point. Some of these keyboards can easily hit $250+ and by that point, are you sure you wanna waste your hard earned money on something you could easily spill a drink on and ruin in the blink of an eye?  When it comes to keyboards, there are so many options to pick from - membrane vs mechanical keyboards, normal vs low profile, and of course the various cherry mx switches (brown, red, silver, blue, black, etc). I think it took me around 2 days before I finally came up with personal preferences (you should probably do the same).  I went to microcenter and tried out the various keyboards they had on display (Corsair K70 / K95, Razer Huntsman Elite / Chroma, Logitech G915 / Pro X). I also took hours out of my day and listened to various YouTube videos on the differences between all of the cherry mx switches.I wanted something right in the middle - clicks not too quiet but not too loud, design not too aggressive looking but not too basic either, font something professional but also relaxing to look at, and something practical to use without running into too many gimmicks. I always preferred low profile keyboards because for me, the normal profile keyboards are too big, bulky, and in my opinion, a remnant of the 90s. After hours of typing and gaming, your fingers get tired of wrestling around with the keys. At the same time, you don\'t want a super sensitive keyboard either that registers a hit just as soon as you breathe in its general direction. For this reason I decided to go with the cherry red & brown switches (the best \"all around\" switches for typing AND gaming). Both of them have the same activation force (45cn) and are fairly quiet but audible enough, the only difference being, the brown switches have a tactile feedback whereas the red switches are linear. Think of this tactile feedback as a minor \"bump\" in the road to let you know the conditions of the road without actually seeing the potholes. Being a fairly confident typist, I decided to go with the cherry reds since the tactile feedback could in theory become tiresome over long periods of time. Keep in mind even with linear keys, you can still feel the key so it\'s not like you are typing on nothing. It comes down to more or less \"clicky\" feeling. Finally, the RGB lights. I had no real preference on them. They look cool but at the end of the day, they are just fancy lights you don\'t really need for gaming or typing.My research was complete so I dropped by microcenter. Keyboards everywhere, most of them the same generic 90s keyboards I dreaded using but with a price tag of $150 and above. One keyboard definitely stuck out above all others - the Roccat Vulcan. A sturdy aluminum plate, low profile keys with the switches visually exposed, and an overall sleek design with multimedia controls, I immediately knew I had to touch it.  I hopped on, opened a word document, and started typing. It didn\'t disappoint one bit. It performed just as well as it looked.  I powered through sentences as fast as I could type them (last I checked, my wpm was around 50-60). Minimal mistakes were made and that\'s solely because I didn\'t have a chair to sit on. Only one final test remained - gaming. Seeing as microcenter didn\'t have any available games (or chairs for that matter), I decided to pull the trigger.3 days later my keyboard came in and once again it didn\'t disappoint.  This keyboard, personally for me, is built as close to perfection as possible. Hitting the keys are now so incredibly satisfying now and they feel incredible. I love everything about the keyboard. It\'s great for long term typing and gaming - going on 5 hours now no problem. It\'s visually pleasing to look at, even without the RGB lights but the lights do make it even more of a pleasure to look at. I didn\'t fool around with the lights too much yet but there is a program (Swarm) that lets you customize the light patterns  as well as setup multiple profiles and macros. The keyboard also comes with a magnetic wrist rest and braided cable to let you know it\'s of high quality design. Most importantly, the $120 price tag is extremely reasonable for a keyboard of this quality (I believe it\'s $150 at microcenter).  Most of its best selling competitors are $150 and up and they don\'t even look half as good. The K70 low profile starts at $160 as well as the Razer Huntsman Elite. I\'m a huge fan of the DeathAdder (my current mouse) but Razer Huntmans Elite keyboard clicks were EXTREMELY audible and I hear their build quality has fallen off in the past few years. Roccat is a German manufacturer so when they advertise that they take pride in their builds, I can believe it.I haven\'t run into any cons yet, at least nothing noticeable. As for improvements to future models, I know Corsair includes a USB port on their keyboard as well as a giant X underneath the keyboard through which cables can be run and held in place - both of which this keyboard lacks. Not a complaint from my end as I have more USB ports on my rig than I know what to do with and the cable\'s length is long enough - around 5-6ft I believe. The final test for this keyboard is the reliability test. I\'m hoping it lasts for at least 3 years. I will report back if I run into any issues with soft or hardware.Final verdict: 10/10 - I highly recommend it.','2021-12-19 23:16:54',5,3,222),(542,'  I bought this keyboard on 4/20/2020. It was great for a few months, then sometime in August, the \"a\" key and \"Left Shift\" key stopped being as responsive. As a gamer, I would mostly notice this in game when trying to strafe left or crouch/crouch move. I did all the steps the Amazon tech suggested, who then recommended to reach out to the manufacturer to ask for a replacement. The manufacturer gave me similar steps with a couple additional ones, which did not resolve the issue at all. The \"Left Shift\" key is extremely noticeable when typing now. The manufacturer did say it\'s likely a faulty switch, but neither them, nor Amazon is willing to respond to resolve the issue. DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS KEYBOARD.','2019-11-18 14:15:00',1,5,222),(543,'  I was in the market for a new \"daily driver\" all rounder keyboard and this one caught my eye. After reading the specs and actually watching a review on Youtube I decided to pull the trigger. I wanted to like this keyboard. Spending this much on a keyboard I wanted to like it very much... but from the time it arrived shipped in its own retail box (no outer box...  shame on you Amazon) I was disappointed. For this price they have set the bar rather high for themselves and unfortunately they missed the mark in almost every respect.The LEDs are blinding! The secondary functions on the key caps are barely visible unless you have the LEDs turned up all the way. At which point they become VERY distracting. When viewed from even the slightest of angles it becomes the first keyboard I feel I need to shield my eyes from...Bad switch. You can slowly press  a key down past the \" tactile bump\" a MEASURABLE  distance before the key stroke registers. This distance varies from key to key as does the severity of the tactile bump. The action feels rough and gritty. It is not pleasant nor is it comfortable to type on. I felt my fingers begin to fatigue just minutes into use.  There is very little key wobble but at the sacrifice of smooth action. In games the action was too stiff. I felt my movement to be hindered and was missing the easiest of shots.The software is what I have come to expect from these companies...Basic. Bare-bones. One of the biggest features missing is the ability to layer lighting effects.They key caps are ABS and have a nice almost velvety texture that will be lost to finger shine within the first day of use.  They are produced in house for this switch. Aftermarket key caps will not fit these switches.There is so much keyboard flex it feels like you can twist the thing into a pretzel. The aluminum top plate is very thin and seems to be there more for looks than actual rigidity.The wrist rest is not padded and is uncomfortable.The highest quality feature of this item is the volume control dial. Very definitive steps and felt well made.For this price there are FAR better options out there. This keyboard is over thought and under engineered. It is way over priced for what you are getting.','2021-12-05 15:29:15',1,16,222),(544,'  I bought this keyboard a month ago along with the roccat leadr mouse.  I\'ve had nothing but problems with both products.  The keyboard is beautiful and feels great and I would love to say I loved it.  But periodically the lights stop moving and the swarm software just hangs.  Talking to support has been slow and painful.  They have had me reinstall the software to no avail.  I\'ve adjusted to just living with this.  As long as I don\'t use the sofware or reboot my computer it seems to work fairly reliably.  Course after a reboot or if I use the control panel to change lighting settings on the keyboard there is a good chance it will hang.  Once it does there is no fix other than unplugging the keyboard and plugging it back in.  I really wish I could fix this as I like the keyboard quite a bit.  Now on to post about the leadr mouse.','2017-08-09 09:00:00',1,2,222),(545,'  UPDATED REVIEW:I\'ve had this keyboard exactly a week now and I am still very pleased with it. It\'s one of the best keyboards I\'ve ever used. It seems well made and like it should hold up for a number of years if you take care of it. I\'m very pleased.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I searched for a good mechanical keyboard for about 2 months. Originally I wanted a tenkeyless keyboard, and I actually purchased the Corsair K100 TKL, but it had silver speed switches on that were way too sensitive. It was great to game with though, but terrible for typing. I wished this keyboard had brown/tactile switches, but because it didn\'t I ended up sending it back. I type on a keyboard much more than I game with one. Then I got the Logitech G915 at a great price on eBay (nearly $100 off brand new). I thought I\'d be pleased with that keyboard, but it was a bigger disappointment than the Corsair K100 TKL. I don\'t recommend it. I looked at a few other keyboards, and even bought another one from Corsair (from their website) and cancelled it because it didn\'t ship in nearly three weeks.In all of my research, I had come across this one from time to time. The thing that kept me from buying it was that I thought the keys being raised were a gimmick and wouldn\'t be that easy to type with. Well, I was wrong. This keyboard is super easy to type with, and is one of the best keyboards I have ever used. Correction, IT IS the best keyboard I have ever used. Typing on this thing is effortless.I have the tactical version of this keyboard, which is similar to brown switches. The RGB lighting is great on it right out of the box, and that\'s why I used (the default). The look of this keyboard is very sleek with black brushed aluminum, and doesn\'t feel cheap at all. Aside from typing, that\'s another thing I love about it. It looks cool on my desk. And the slim form factor is right up my alley. Coming from a Corsair K55 full sized keyboard, I didn\'t want another big and bulky board. But this one is perfect - even with the palm rest. When it comes to typing, the sound is not loud at all. It\'s a very satisfying tactile sound, that most probably won\'t pick up on if you\'re in a Zoom / Teams / web meeting. either. The keys sound great when typing. The volume knob is simple to use, and instead of twisting it, I usually just place my hand to the side of it and scroll it backward or forward. It has a tactile feel as well, and is easy to control. I haven\'t had a chance to game with it, so I can\'t speak on that, but it seems like it should be no problem. I could go on and on, but I don\'t want to be longwinded. Other people have left great reviews, and they were right.Lastly, I was able to catch this keyboard on sale for $109.99, which was $50 off the regular price. I probably would\'ve bought it anyway, but still - I\'m happy about that. I recommend it.','2021-03-14 17:00:00',5,1,222),(546,'  Brown switches are great for typing.  Terrible for gaming.  I was hoping the 0.2mm reduction in actuation and travel was going to be the difference maker - it wasn\'t.  Mechanical switches that aren\'t \"speed\" are absolutely bad for gaming.  Just don\'t.This keyboard killed my joy for gaming so much when I was trying to adjust,  so much that I ended up not playing anything because I hated the feel of my favorite games.  The key press and actuation are still way too long for gaming.  While this is better than the Philips that I tried, it\'s still way too much over priced and over hyped for what it achieves.I only considered it namely because it had more of the features that I wanted in  keyboard than others, but the volume knob is terribly placed and implemented that it may as well be missing.  A stiff volume knob is fine, but when it requires a thumb and forefinger to use, having it so close to the upper keys will interfere, and that makes it more of  hassle to use than it\'s worth.  Also, requiring software installed in order to change ANYTHING about the RGB is a no-no.While I got it on sale, I can\'t even recommend it at the sale price.While I like brown switches for typing, the tactile response seems diminished with this iteration, and the travel is still too long.  So much so, that I am considering permanently returning to mecha-membrane or the like switches, because mechanical is in the sorriest state right now.  The \"fastest\" switches are without tactile feedback, which I enjoy, and ruins my enjoyment.','2021-01-05 23:30:00',2,15,222),(547,'  This keyboard is amazing but not for the clumsy. If you\'ve spilled a drink on your keyboard more than 3 times in your life I may say avoid it as it takes days to unstick your keys and you can\'t remove them, just the caps. Stay for tips on how to clean this thing. Overall this thing is sleek, solid, and sexy. I have the cherry red keys but would have loved to have tried the brown. It was important for me to have a quiet, wireless keyboard so having a corded mechanical keyboard wasn\'t even on my mind. After a few videos learning about mechanical keyboards I decided to give this one a go, was pleasantly surprised plus the braided cord on this is stylish. It\'s quieter than my last Logitech keyboard, more responsive, lower profile with all of the functionality, but not as comfortable as the hand rest they provide (detachable) is just hard plastic. This was 100% a style decision because it looks good but feels like crap. Roccat should definitely create a comfortable attachable wrist rest and give a discount to those who purchased this with the hard plastic one. Like me. Let\'s talk about how to clean this thing if you have any accidents. Please note, I\'m not responsible for your messing up your own keyboard, nor is the company. This has worked for me.Cleaning:If you are clumsy enough to have spilled a sticky drink over your ballin new keyboard the way to get it back in order is to use rubbing alcohol with some q-tips. Unplug your keyboard. Remove the black cap of the sticky keys affected, dip the q-tip in some rubbing, stronger the better, and press the wet q-tip into the exposed sticky key. It\'s fine if the clear capsule gets a bunch of rubbing alcohol in it. Constantly press the keys as quickly as you can to spread the rubbing alcohol and clean away whatever drink got there in the first place. Do about 3 times a day. As you press on the keys you\'ll notice it feels normal however the stickiness will return after it sets for awhile. You have to this for about 4 days for everything to be back to normal, you will notice it getting progressively better.Quick review:-The lighting effects are great i just wish the ripple effect was able to remain backlit with a solid color while in use. It\'s the greatest preset but hard to use in the dark. No, the wave effect isn\'t the same.-I\'ve seen people talking about the edge of the keys being sharp on youtube, wth are they doing with this keyboard? Just type on it. lol- The knob can use some more graphics, even just lines. It\'s a feature but it\'s bland on your keyboard. Maybe it\'ll help if it were metal-  I\'m glad they didn\'t use the traditional cherry keys. Roccat Keys are lit, literally. The height of the clear portion makes the keys hover which is classy. Everyone should follow this model. I think the roccat team can go above and beyond and make these module and dominate the field.- Now that I know how to clean this thing, I love it. Guys, get rid of the two screws above the F1 and F4 keys, I just noticed them while writing the review.- I\'m not using this keyboard as a gamer, I\'m a designer. I have little need to use the game mode but the software should let you change the function of the keys for various software and detect that software like my logi mx master mouse does.That\'s it guys. TLDR. The keyboard is good. If you aren\'t someone who cares about style and you don\'t care about lights, but you care about silence, you can go for a switch-key. I like this one though, I\'d buy again. Your friends will notice this keyboard when they visit.','2021-12-19 23:16:49',4,3,222),(548,'            Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n        \n\n\n   To start I just want to note that this keyboard has all the features I was looking for as not a lot of boards out there have good features and are still tkl (I don’t like full or 6065%).I’ve had many keyboards as I’m a bit of a fanatic. This one however has some of the worst ping I’ve ever heard on a keyboard let alone a thin metal top plated tkl. I have no idea why it’s so bad but just watch the video I attached and turn up the volume. It sounds like your typing on a foot-long garage door spring lol. Compare it to something like a g915 tkl which is almost identical in form factor and it’s night and day difference.Anyone that has used or tried to use the razer huntsman te knows that the V1 optical red switches were terrible for typing on that. Well these are almost identical the weight of both these switches is way too light and the actuation was way too quick at just one millimeter on the razer and feels almost the same on this. Though the specs on these switches on the Vulcan TKL are not the same they as I said feel almost identical when you type on them the switches are too light and they actuate far too easily creating many typos. I’m sure they would be fine in game but I’m not a fan of actuations when resting my fingers on the keys.Which brings me to my next point. The key caps on this keyboard are spray-painted black ABS and probably the cheapest thinnest things I’ve seen on any keyboard I’ve ever had. Absolutely terrible. I tried the razor PBT key caps on it which fit but felt very strange bottoming out due to the switch design. I also tried the hyper X pudding key caps they felt the same way and given the performance and the sound I didn’t even bother trying to install the software. I returned mine.That’s said, I love the detachable USB-C. The form factor. The lighting isn’t the greatest even though you’d think it would be which is strange. The volume and mute are great. If you haven’t used a mechanical keyboard before you might be able to stomach this but even typing on it I lost track of what I was typing due to how loud the ping is (not the switch but the ringing sound after hitting a key).I wanted to love it but it was a no from me. On a side note it’s fairly obvious the vine reviews on this have no idea what they are talking about which is why I’m writing this as those are so incredibly off base.','2021-12-19 23:16:50',1,6,223),(549,'  I decided to get a TKL keyboard for my setup since i already own a G915 tactical and a NK65 V2 aluminum. I wanted to get another mechanical so I decided to pre-order a tkl pro. This keyboard uses their titan optical key switches but they remind me of linear red switches. I have never used such a loud linear switch before. Part of the blame is the key travel seems crazy long but i also think the short keycaps cause my expectations to be similar to the low-profile g915 which it is not! I was able to mitigate the issue by using o-rings/dampeners on the keycaps giving me a nice shorter stroke and less noise if I bottom out, but this did not fix the \"thunk\" when the cap moves back upwards so it is still loud and i hope break-in fixes this somewhat.The keycaps are oil magnets btw and to me they feel flimsy, slippery, and cheap (abs). The keycap is relatively small and cuts out part of the normal bottom, but I am not sure if I like this design as they make pudding keycaps to give more lighting if that is what they are trying to do.The switches are mounted directly onto the keyboard\'s top panel which is nice for cleaning. The media controls are also the f9-f12 keys, but you can semi-permanently switch them with fn+del (turns the del key white to show it is switched/active). There is also a dedicated mute button and volume control both of which I do not believe you can re-map.Overall I\'m not sure why the vulcan tkl pro is so expensive. I wish it came with a magnetic wrist rest for the price like their full-size version, but my wood glorious wrist rest (TKL size) fits perfect. I am not sure if i would purchase a roccat product again as I don\'t believe there is much value for the money and that is saying a lot as a g915 owner.Edit: i decided to throw on some pbs doubleshot alpherior keys i had laying around, and the difference is huge! no more slippery buttons! I\'d highly suggest getting new keycaps, all though i kept the original F9-F12 since they are also the media buttons and i also kept INS, HOME, PG-UP, PG-DOWN, DEL, END and the arrow keys and the ctrl key.','2021-12-19 23:16:51',3,11,223),(550,'  I really wanted to like this keyboard, in pictures it really looks great.  Setup was easy, and looked great on my desk.  (sound bar is weird, not sure why manufactures think that is a good idea)My problem was that it was not a silent keyboard.  Much louder then I was looking for, I had hoped the new switches would really cut down the sound and they did not.Second issue that I had was the gaps between the keys.  I didn\'t realize but when gaming my fingers float close to the keyboard and with this keyboard would catch myself in the gaps between the keys.  Turns out for me a keyboard deck is something I really need.So back to my Logitech k740.','2021-12-19 23:16:52',2,9,223),(551,'  Unless you are thinking about switching out your keyboard every time you want to do anything OTHER than gaming, don\'t buy this keyboard. The short travel cause too many accidental keystrokes. Actually even during gaming I find myself hitting E when I am trying to reload (R).Fine, perhaps that is just me and my typing habits aren\'t conducive to a perfect user experience when it comes to this keyboard.Here is the other problem I ran into. One of my keys (;) randomly (or I just have never noticed) became sticky. No i have not spilled anything on it or had food on it nor did I touch the keyboard with dirty hands. I could not figure out how to clean it besides taking it all apart. Now this was where this keyboard really pissed me off. (or the a-hole of a design team, rather) They put a screw underneath the rubber feet. I suppose they were not planning for this keyboard to be user serviceable or cleanable.So, I opened the damn thing up and found some residue on the back of the PCB (not somewhere I could dirty). I think that was what contributed to the sticky key. By the way, I couldn\'t find any repair guide online but you CAN remove the clear cap from the back by pushing in the tabs from either side which will allow you to gain access to the spring, rail and the cylinder...Anyways, since this keyboard is my first and last mechanical keyboard, I\'m going to try to make it last (for the pretty penny I\'ve paid). Not sure if lubing up a keyboard is something that ALL mechanical keyboard users find themselves doing... Suppose I am learning.Quick Summery:The lighting - boring without having to install the program. I\'ve never found RGB to be an important part of the computing/gaming experience. Sure as F wasn\'t about to make it a fashion statement. This keyboard did NOT change my mind.Noise - Well, there are no quiet long-travel keyboards (not to my knowledge. I thought at least with optical switches I\'d abstain myself from the narcissistic clickery and spare the ears of whoever is on the other end of the voice call. Frankly my computer is also located in my acoustically treated studio. There is just no getting away from the plastic on plastic auditory fckery.Macro - Nah, not flexible enough. HEY rotary encodes are cool but not when they are limited to ONE purpose. Get creative dev team.Cool factor - Besides the occasional reconciliation brought on by my non-computer oriented friends \"wow you have one of those light up keyboards?!\" I\'ve found myself drowning in self loathing for having bought into this idiotic trend of self indulgence. No. This keyboard will not make you cooler. Not if you are honest with yourself.Ergonomic - Coming from a shitty HP low profile keyboard, I\'ve found myself needing to buy a wrist rest with how high this keyboard forces you to bend your wrist. Don\'t want carpal tunnel? Get a thinner keyboard. Never had numbness with my HP keyboard until I switched.I regret my purchase but obviously your mileage will very. May luck be in your favour.','2021-12-19 23:16:53',2,20,223),(552,'  Originally, I was a bit unimpressed with the keyboard but figured I would just stick with it as overall build seemed solid. As time has gone on it has deteriorated in two key areas. First, the keystroke feel went from slightly better than rubber dome to zero feedback where I just have to hard bottom every key to be confident of my keystroke. I have had to slow down my typing speed to ensure I am hitting each key. The other area is the keycaps have started to flake apart where whatever material they coated the keys with is flaking away from use (see photo).At this point I plan to just toss new keycaps on it and give it to the kids to use on their computer and get a WASD code (backlight helps when I am in programs with wonky shortcuts in a dark room).Pros:Build quality on the baseplate is solidVery easy to cleanMagnetic wrist-rest is coolRGB if you like thatCons:It isn\'t actually a good typing keyboardPriced way too high for the typing experience it offersSeems to wear faster than most other known brands I have usedKeycaps are garbageTLDR: You can get more for less from better brands with tried and true switches.','2021-12-19 23:16:54',2,2,223),(553,'  I\'ve had plenty of keyboards before of all kinds including with laptops included. This keyboard definitely has a custom click to it but it is a nice click for sure! I do like how each key sounds, enter, backspace are especially nice. Not sure what the above reviewers are talking about with some kind of ringing to the click, I hear none of that. That would be way too particular for me though so it\'s not even a thing. I\'m a software engineer so I do type quite fast.This is the first time I\'ve tried a TKL board for home use but I don\'t use the other pad that often so we\'ll try it because the compact size is welcome! I also enjoy the lighting schemes especially the main intelligent typing one that lights the keys up as you type with more emphasis on ones held longer or pushed more while change colors throughout. It\'s kinda like a heat map almost.Beautiful keyboard for sure and I can tell that the quickness is pretty snappy. Not sure how to gauge the value/money ratio but I didn\'t buy this for value or money, I bought this for premium and coolness first then functionality for the money second.','2021-12-19 23:16:55',5,18,223),(554,'  So, I got this to be primarily a gaming keyboard. I paid special attention to typing reviews because even while gaming typing is sometimes required. I was looking for an all-rounder but with a stronger focus on gaming... I also wanted it to be able to resist a splash of water (that\'s how I lost my previous keyboard and why I needed this one). The volume knob is quite pleasant to use and the minimal profile really does it for me. I did find the keycaps to be unusual at first, but it\'s actually fantastic. I tried swapping keycaps and it made the board sound less crisp, plus the space between the caps allows for amazing RGB and easier typing (less likely to hit adjacent keys). Pretty rare to find a great gaming keyboard that also does well for typing. Bottom line... this competes with these new extremely expensive premiums boards and does it just as good or better in all areas (assuming you don\'t absolutely need adjustable actuation switches for some reason). I definitely think this is the best priced mechanical gaming board right now. If only they had this in a 65% layout for a few bucks cheaper.The one thing I was worried about was the reports of spring ping and unpleasant case noise. Well, I can tell you the spring pingy-ness is pretty minimal. The only thing I heard was the mildly rattley stabilizers (which are much better than most pre-build gaming boards). However, I detest any noticable rattle in my spacebar sooo... I modded them (have to open the case which I assume voids any warranty) with some krytox 205g0 and added a little bit of foam. With optical switches no soldering is required to fully disassemble this keyboard. I would only recommend doing a mod on this board if you have some experience with board modding, as the keycaps are very delicate and the stabs are non-standard so if something gets broken you\'ll have a useless unreturnable board.','2021-12-19 23:16:56',5,17,223),(555,'  This keyboard has some awesome features.  This is by far the most I\'ve ever paid for a keyboard. Having the volume know on the top right was a pretty neat feature that I didn\'t even read about. I enjoy gaming in my free time, when I get free time.  I\'ve had this key oa4d for roughly a month to month and a half, I dont get to game terribly often.  But within this short time, my w key, which in most games is the forward button, has begun to have this rubbing sort of sound when the key is depressed. I\'ve attempted to blow it out in case dust has collected.  At this point I\'m unsure of what\'s causing the noise, but it is annoying and disappointing. I attempted to venture away from razer, and this is proving to be a mistake.  It\'s pretty cool that you can change lighting affects and such, but for me. The operational ability of the keyboard is of utmost importance.  Now I\'ll have to live with this annoying sound until I feel like spending money to replace this nearly brand new keyboard.10-18-21I have to drop the rating even further, This keyboard barely lasted me 3 months and worked OK in that time.  Eventually keys became unresponsive.  I\'ve had to replace it, it was a complete waste of money.Purchased May 4 2021, stopped using early september.','2021-12-19 23:16:57',1,1,223),(556,'  Wonderful keyboard, switch feel is great and profile is flat like a g915 but with a slightly higher height that is somewhere in between a 915 and a ducky one mini. The keycaps will be a sticking point for some as they are not pbt but I work in healthcare and my hands are typically super dry so these provide more grip that is in between a traditional abs and pbt cap. Switch feel is wonderful as well, and at least on par with razr and steel series optical switches but they feel the most like a cherry red out of any that I have used. Overall it’s a wonderful keyboard and I almost forgot to mention build quality seems good as well for the price, not all plastic like a ducky and not all aluminum like a drop, which makes sense since it’s priced smack in the middle of those two.','2021-12-19 23:16:58',5,11,223),(557,'  I\'ve never written a review for a product on the same day as receiving it, but I was so impressed with this keyboard I immediately bought a second for my nephew and I\'m ready to slam a 5-star.This is my first experience with linear actuation or optical switches. I\'ve heard people say this board does a pretty good job with typing -- so that it\'s useful for beyond just gaming -- and let me just say, that holds true. I\'m quite a speedy touch typist (120+ wpm), and I can type as fast as ever with only minimal errors, which should only improve with some more time on the board. I saw some say this keyboard is loud, but it isn\'t really. I suspect this is from people bottoming out on their key strokes, but if you\'re a more skilled typist you will learn the actuation point and type much lighter and quieter since the linear switches don\'t require you to bottom out your presses.When it comes to gaming, wow, what a difference. The smooth strokes and quick response feels like it has lifted the skill ceiling on movement. I can actually dance around with my hand on the keyboard much faster to do the things I want to do, and I feel much more precise. I did not expect a keyboard to make such a big difference, but if you are being bottlenecked on a slower board, then this definitely will make a difference for you as it has for me.The weight of the board is really solid and the key presses are super soft. The RGB looks great and you can assign different lighting to individual keys in the software.Only one gripe so far: ABS keycaps.For a $140 board it would be nice to have PBT, but I knew this when I got it. Still, the finish on the keys is actually very nice and feels much better than your typical ABS caps.The tldr of all this -- amazing for gaming, yet still solid for typing. Super comfy to type on and feels quality.','2021-12-19 23:16:59',5,3,223),(558,'  I really like the feel of this keyboard. Typing and gaming feels great, and the over all build of this keyboard is top-notch. Be warned though - like many mechanical keyboards, typing on this keyboard can be loud. So I wouldn\'t recommend this for office use. But for my home use, it\'s perfect.  I even managed to replace the keycaps with that of another brand.Performance:During long gaming sessions, I found that the keys felt more comfortable than other keyboards I\'ve used in the past. I think the reason for this is that I don\'t actually have to press as hard for the keys to register. Razer states that the keys on the Huntsman require slightly less force and register quicker than other keyboards. All I can say is that this keyboard feels \"broken-in\" for lack of a better term. It just feels good, and \"fast.\" Additionally, the keyboard has 4 media buttons and a moveable dial (one of the 4 buttons is the dial itself - as it can be pushed in, in addition to being rotated) - all of which can be remapped to your liking. By default, they were set to control music playback - in my case, it controls Spotify. I never really planned on using these media controls, but now that I have them - I can never go back. It\'s great when I\'m playing a game with my own music running, but also being able to pause that music should a cutscene in the game start to play - all by pressing a button.Lack of Macro keys and USB ports:Unfortunately, the Razer Huntsman does not have macro keys like other keyboards in its price range (Corsair\'s K95 does have them). Understandably, this would have been nice to have for some users. (Personally I never used macro keys much myself when I had keyboards that did have them.) Also present on other expensive keyboards is a USB passthrough port. Again, the Huntsman lacks this as well.Loud keys:As stated before, most mechanical keyboards are \"loud\" and can annoy people who maybe sitting relatively close to you. If you are in an office situation, I would recommend using a different keyboard that has \"quiet\" mechanical keys like Cherry Browns on a Corsair keyboard; or Razer Orange keys on the Razer Blackwidow. Unfortunately, Razer does not offer a more \"quiet\" version of the Huntsman Elite at this time.Lighting:The keys on the Huntsman are quite bright, even when compared to Razer\'s other offerings like the Ornata Chroma. The difference here is that while the letters on the keys of the Huntsman are significantly brighter; the Ornata Chroma\'s underlying membrane is also illuminated giving the keys the illusion that they are floating on a \"bed of light.\" I wish that Razer somehow found a way to also duplicate that bed of light effect on the Huntsman, but I am definitely happy with the extra bright letters. As you can imagine, the lighting on the Huntsman can be customized to pretty much anything you can imagine.Key Replacement:I replaced the keycaps on my Huntsman with Doubleshot PBT Keycaps from HyperX, after seeing a popular Youtube personality replace his. (These Keycaps run about $25, and are meant for HyperX\'s own mechanical keboard.) And while not all the HyperX Keycaps were compatible (the larger keycaps for RETURN, SHIFT, SPACEBAR, etc did not fit the Hunstman\'s switches), I still managed to replace most of the keyscaps. The over all effect is that the keyboard is now even more illuminated. That\'s because the bottom of the HyperX Keycaps (which are made of white plastic) react with the lighting to give a more brilliant glow to the entire keyboard.  Since replacing the keycaps on the Huntsman seemed to work; I would assume a fair number of other keycaps types would probably work for the Huntsman as well.  But of course please do your own research before purchasing.Software:The Huntsman uses two USB connectors. Once connected, you must download the latest version of Razer Synapse. This is Razer\'s all-in-one software for all their PC keyboards, mice, etc. I actually own several Razer products, and after using Synapse for over a year, I\'ve gotten used to using it. It\'s not hard to use, but it could definitely use some interface improvement. Still, most users can easily get to the most important things such as lighting customization, re-assigning keys, and making macros. Razer does require a login with your information for the software to work. The reasoning I suppose is that you can use the same settings if  you use the same Razer products on several PCs. I would assume that most people don\'t use this feature - but I actually do. I use Razer products at my home and at my work - so this actually works well for me.  Settings that I make at home can easily be assigned at my work and vice-versa.Conclusion:The Huntsman is a pretty pricey keyboard with exceptional build quality. The body is metal, and the keys are stabilized so that there is minimum \"wobble.\" Add to this the \"fast\" actuation feel, and you have an excellent high-end keyboard. Gaming, and typing feel really great. If you can forgive the \"loud\" keys, this is an excellent option if you\'re looking for a high-end keyboard for gaming and work.','2020-09-10 03:00:00',4,6,227),(559,'  OK... first off what I wasn\'t really happy about. I just got my shipment yesterday the package came opened the seal tape the keeps the box closed was already cut. That was a little upsetting but I\'ll get over it. Another bad thing.. the media keys that are on my keyboard are not working. I\'m sure its not the keyboard itself because when I first plugged it in they were working fine so it must be a program on my computer that is overlapping spotify and youtube... I just havent figured it out yet, and no its not google music on chrome browser. Lastly the app that comes with the Razer keyboard.. super laggy at first... but after I restarted my computer worked just fine... and was able to customize the colors to my liking.OVERALL... the last keyboard I replaced the Huntsman with was the Razer Chroma Black Widow I had it for around 5 years .. and I have to say it is nothing like it!!.. The Huntsman blows that keyboard out of the water. This keyboard feels great sounds great and I am in LOVE with it. It is super smooth to type on and game on. I read one of the negative reviews for the keyboard after I purchased it saying \"my fat fingers press down on the keyboard to hard and the stands collapse.!\" haven\'t had that issue. Also the wrist cushion stays in place and is super comfy.IF you are up in the air right now and can\'t decided wither or not to get the k95 or razer huntsman? Get the Huntsman you won\'t be disappointed','2021-07-30 04:00:00',4,15,227),(560,'  Buyer beware!  This keyboard gets one star because I just received a response from Razer support confirming that using profiles or any of the \"special features\" on this keyboard requires signing into the Razer app.  IN OTHER WORDS:  This $200 keyboard reverts to a normal keyboard without an internet connection (or unless you sign into the Razer app).  Why brag about on-board memory?','2021-12-19 23:16:54',1,11,227),(561,'  This keyboard is beautiful. The media controls are perfect. The wrist rest feels luxurious. The laser keys are a neat addition to mechanical keyboards. So where does this product go wrong? I have had several issues where the laser keys were sticking (!!!) - this was seemingly caused by connection errors between the keyboard and the wrist rest contacts separating during use. Disconnecting the rest and connecting it usually fixes the problem. I also experienced an issue where the keyboard was completely unresponsive upon start-up which meant an inability to access the number pad to enter my pin. Disconnecting the keyboard and reconnecting it seemed to reconnect me. Additionally, there are times on start-up where the keyboard is completely unresponsive until the Razer software has finished loading at the desktop. I\'m pretty bummed out that this keyboard acts up more than my old second-hand keyboard did. I hardly use it for gaming now, as this was my intent when buying it, because of the aforementioned issues. But hey, it sure is a pretty keyboard - just sometimes it\'s as functional as the Commodore 64 Classic.','2019-11-18 14:15:00',2,12,227),(562,'  The cons are that it\'s pretty loud, is expensive, doesn\'t have a USB passthrough while still taking up 2 USB ports (1 is for the board and the lighting for the keys, the other is for the lighting on the border and for the wrist rest), and doesn\'t have macro keys. If you don\'t mind those things like me, then this is the best keyboard ever made.  The lighting effects are, to put quite simply, dope. There is a ludicrous amount of customization with Razer\'s software for the RGB. Different effects, patterns, colors, speeds, frequencies, are all at your disposal. The crisp click of each key makes you feel like you\'re an old badass typewriting expert (If that\'s not a thing, then it is now). This is one of the few \"gaming\" mechanical keyboards that doesn\'t feature gigantic, silly letters. It is clean and sophisticated. The aluminum frame is cool to the touch and gives it a nice weight. Feels like pure class. The wrist rest is absurdly comfortable and soft. Luxurious. If you like to type, to game, and to look damn good while you do it then treat yourself to this awesome board.','2021-12-05 15:29:15',5,1,227),(563,'  The Huntsman Elite certainly LOOKS great on a desk.  However, for a $200 keyboard, it has a few flaws:1.  No USB-passthrough.  Want to connect your mouse to the Huntsman Elite?  Nope.  You can\'t.2.  It has no dedicated keyboard LED controls.  To change the brightness and other LED features, you have to hold down the Fn key and press F9-F12.  HOWEVER, the F9-F12 keys doesn\'t have dedicated LEDs that tell you what they do!3.  The wrist rest is awkward.  It slopes up from the base of the keyboard.4.  No dedicated programmable keys.5.  The keys are a bit smaller than found on most gaming keyboards.All that being said, the Huntsman Elite isn\'t a BAD keyboard...but, in my opinion, doesn\'t qualify as an \"Elite\" keyboard by any stretch.','2017-08-09 09:00:00',3,4,227),(564,'  This is a seriously badass keyboard setup. With the optical switches, there is a difference. If you play PUBG you will notice with looting and pulling up the menu or even opening doors. This got rid of any input lag that I could notice from my previous mechanical keyboard. It is pretty expensive but worth the money. I am happy to see that Razer has increased the quality on their products, because in previous products they were always harped on for their poor quality control or lack of finish, but I can say this is the perfect keyboard.EDIT: I have owned the Huntsman elite since September 15, 2018 and it has finally given out on me. Multiple driver reinstalls and switching keyboards, the razer is unusable due to multiple keystroke glitches. It was good while it lasted. Great wrist rest.','2021-03-14 17:00:00',4,9,227),(565,'  Apparently there\'s an issue with the wrist rest? It\'s causing the keyboard to cut out or respond sluggishly. I removed the wrist rest and it seemed to be ok. Regardless for $200 this thing better be 100% out of the box and it wasn\'t. I returned it. I normally use a blackwidow TE v2 keyboard.I was excited for this keyboard, but I\'ll wait to see how V2 is.','2021-01-05 23:30:00',1,20,227),(566,'  So I think the easiest way to describe what\'s wrong with this is simple. I\'m typing this review with a normal junky Dell keyboard... now I\'m going to type exactly the same review with the Razer,SO ITHnk theasiest waytodescribe what\'s writh is imple. I\"m typing this reviw ith anormal junky DEL keyboard. nowI\"M goin o type exactly the same rviw with eRAzer.(pulls out the Dell again)Back to the drawing board? Worked excellently day 1... today is day 2... and the keys seem to logically \"stick\", which is really quite something. Meaningfully unusable.','2021-12-19 23:16:49',1,11,227),(567,'  I will update if they ever do a firmware change which fixes their color profile issue.  This is an awesome keyboard, except if you\'re offline or without the razor 3.0 software (still in beta) which is the -only- way to load your color profile.  This means it defaults to a RGB color shift by default (they could easily release a firmware change which makes it 1 solid white color or make it load from the internal memory the first profile saved).  But instead if you\'re offline or logged in and software isn\'t loaded keyboard\'s default is a terrible color profile which rotates colors constantly.  For the price of the keyboard and in 2020 is unacceptable.  Razor made an amazing keyboard then blundered on details like this.  Wrist wrest is awesome btw.. Customer support when you ask about the software are TERRIBLE.  They do not understand the issue, or default to claiming it\'s because the software provided is in beta.  That\'s not acceptable either.  If you can are okay with this one issue, you\'ll find yourself with one of the best responding keyboards I\'ve used (you can order off the website for cherry 0ms response as well but also costs more, which they do not tell you).  Media buttons - respond to both regular press AND Shift + Media button.  Without pointing any software it\'s controlling both my audio player (foobar) and my video player (VLC) without conflict.  I cannot however find any documentation on this feature easily (spent a little time searching both online and razer\'s site).  Razer needs to figure out missing these details gets you a bad review when you\'re paying this kind of money for a keyboard.','2021-12-19 23:16:50',1,3,227),(568,'  After loving the wired Viper so much and purchasing the Ultimate, I decided to give Razer another shot with the Huntsman TKL. I have had two of these boards and was not satisfied with either. The first one just seemed odd. I figured it was the actuation force and distance of the optical switches. I returned it. After being disappointed with the keyboard I went with after the Huntsman TKL, I decided to give Razer another shot. I was determined to get used to the switches, because I figured it was best to go with Razer considering Synapse is running on my computer for the Viper Ultimate.I went a good 3 weeks with the second Huntsman TKL. Times when I felt like my character in game was moving without actuating a key, I just brushed it aside and blamed it on my heavy hand. I was wrong. I caught it. Several times my character in game began moving in a direction I didn\'t want it to; I pulled my hand completely off the board and my character would keep strafing in one direction (most often to the right and with the D key).  Having used Cherry MX Silver switches in the past, I truly believe some people claiming the Huntsman TKL is just really sensitive are having the same issues I encountered. I wouldn\'t recommend this board to anyone and I don\'t trust it.It is a shame, really. The decision to move to double shot pbt, standard bottom row, and subtle branding on the board are A+ decisions. Where the board goes south for me is in the optical red switches. They went too far. They are too sensitive, and I question their long-term reliability. If you\'re looking for a mouse, I can comfortably suggest both Viper models. Both the wired and wireless versions I purchased were perfect, and I have even come to love the side buttons. For keyboards, I can\'t recommend the Huntsman TKL.','2021-12-19 23:16:51',2,3,229),(569,'  Update 11/28/19 I deleted a bunch of the review that wasnt relevent as I have learned more about the keyboard/ software and lighting since owning it.I am able to keep a static color now that i uninstalled Synapse. On the 11/13/2019 update below(I deleted that update) I still had Synapse installed and at times I would open it and then disable it and that is why it was changing my colors. If I keep it deactived or uninstalled the keyboard remember my color even after a restart or waking from sleep.Update 11/11/2019 I found you can change colors via the Keyboard only using the FN and CTRL keys(hold both down) along with keys 1, 2, 3 and 4 keys(use these to change colors, strobe, etc). the #2 key(press FN and CTRL keys first, holding both down) is the one you use to cycle thru the static colors. It is not very intuitive but you will figure if you play with them. I happened to come across this watching a YouTube review and someone in the comments mentioned it. If Razer talks about how to do this I seemed to have missed it in the manual.After finding this out I would give the Razer KB a 5 and recommend it over the Steelseries TKL Omipoint. The Steelseries is nice but I prefer the Razer and the price of the Razer was $80 less when I purchased each one. The Razer was listed as used and in Acceptable shape with damage. But the damage was only on the packaging and the keyboard was like new inside the box. I have found a lot of products on Amazon listed as damaged it is only the packaging that is damaged and the product is in perfect condition. I have saved $200 EACH on some items like motherboards, GPU\'s and monitors buying the \"damaged\" item and inside it a like new product.Initial review: Very limited time with these devices so just some quick initial impressions. I have the new Viper Ultimate mouse and the Huntsman TE Keyboard and am having issue after issue with the software(Synapse). This will be kind of random as I will add feedback as I use the devices.I do really like the mouse and keyboard overall, they feel like high-quality materials it is just the software and not storing color profiles that is a BIG negative for me. I also have the new Steelseries Apex Pro TKL with the Omipoint switches and the switches are quite a bit smoother feeling to me. The Steelseries is MUCH quieter than the Razer, the Razer keyboard is LOUD. The Razer sounds cheap/clanky/hollow but feels very solid when typing or gaming on it. Also, the Steelseries can be used without any software installed and you can change settings directly via the keyboard.The Razer keycaps are much better quality \"feeling\" to me. They have a slightly textured and heavy/weighty feel verse the Steelsires smoother keycaps and light/hollow feel.  If you are OK with having the Razer software installed and a REALLY LOUD keyboard I would go for the Razer over the Steelseries considering the price difference. To me, the Razer feels just as \"fast\" as the Steelseries with the Ominipoints adjusted to .4mm activation point. Both are very sensitive and you have to be careful if you rest you fingers on keys it is easy to \"set them off\".I am adding my review of the mouse here because Amazon won\'t let me post a review saying\"Amazon has noticed unusual reviewing activity on this product. Due to this activity, we have limited this product to verified purchase reviews.\" I purchased the mouse directly from Razer\'s online store.But you need to install the software to deactivate the lights on the mouse and charging base. One big drawback is without the software you will have no way of telling the battery level without the software installed, not that I can see anyway.For comparison, I also have a g903, G203, Model 0 and Model 0-. I prefer them in this order Razer Viper Ultimate, G203, Model O-, Model 0 and G903 for gaming. For general desktop use, the G903 is hands-down the best/my favorite with the \"hyper scroll\".','2021-12-19 23:16:52',5,11,229),(570,'  This keyboard surprised me by its build quality. The metal top plate with the subtle Razer name etched into it is very tasteful, and the PBT keycaps that come with this board are phenomenal. You probably won\'t find better on any other mainstream brand. They have slight texture, which I liked, and the font is also attractive. RGB was also bright and understated by the dark metal back plate, giving the board a professional vibe. Removable USB-C is also a great addition, putting this keyboard in line with other mechanical keyboards like the Ducky One 2 TKL or Mini.Having said that, I returned this keyboard.The new red \"opto-mechanical\" switches are linear and have an actuation travel distance of only 1mm. That is faster than even other switch manufacturers \"speed\" switches. I can see this being a great feature if your main reason for purchasing this keyboard is for shooters or games requiring fast reflexes. Otherwise, the short actuation makes typing and other tasks more difficult without carefully using the keyboard. I mainly play shooters casually and MMO\'s like Final Fantasy 14.I found myself pressing the windows key or alt with my palm, which is user error of course. I simply do not want to have to be so light handed when using my keyboard. I would also recommend at least getting a palm rest so that you don\'t have to \"hover\" type to avoid accidentally pressing unwanted keys. HOWEVER, I still recommend this keyboard if you know what you\'re getting into. I desperately wish Razer could offer this keyboard with their orange switches or even a new tactile optical switch with a higher actuation point. The build quality alone made me think twice about returning it.','2021-12-19 23:16:53',4,18,229),(571,'  Out of the box keyboard changes colors, constantly, and is impossible to use, to fix this you have to have their software running.Despite having memory to save profiles, nothing gets saved and as soon as software is turned off keyboard is back to changing colors and is impossible to use - again. You can change profiles all you like, has no effect.I do not even run windows most of the time, so I cant run their software but even if I could - I would not, its ridiculous.Keyboard at this price must first of all be a good keyboard, and it has rolling changing lights you cant disable.Keyboard itself is good, and I would have kept it if I as consumer could actually configure its lighting and use it anyway I like - with linux, without always running their software.','2021-12-19 23:16:54',1,1,229),(572,'  Razer, I feel very weird saying this - you should be extraordinarily proud of the products you\'ve put out in the past few months. Between the Viper, Viper Ultimate, the Tartarus Pro (assuming we fix the stuck input bug), and now the capstone being your Huntsman TE, you\'ve created an exceptional, premium and worthwhile suite of products that even the enthusiast community will appreciate. I got the Huntsman TE out of sheer curiosity to be completely honest. I had full intent of returning the keyboard once I had messed around with it but I am retiring my custom builds for this keyboard because Razer ticks so many important boxes with this keyboard that I feel like you\'ve become an entirely different beast.We\'ll start off the review by saying the inclusion of PBT key caps makes the biggest difference out of any changes and choices you\'ve made. The PBT key caps feel so good, it’s insane. The texture, and muted lighting make this feel like RGB for adults. I love it. I had one issues with a cap showing some plastic flashing from the mold, which made the D key feel gritty and unstable. This is being fixed by a simple replacement, but I\'m sure if I really wanted to I could just grab my file or an Exacto-knife and remove the flashing with no issue.The best place to go with this review is the switches themselves. My first experience with the opto-electric switch design was with your Tartarus Pro, and while my experience with the Tartarus has not been flawless, the switches themselves are very, very good. The era of Cherry MX and MX-style switches is over, or well should be over, by now. The hall effect and opto-electric switches are far superior and hold the promise of being able to offer features and reliability that cherry switches simply never could due to their design. The extremely fast actuation speed of 1mm is insane, ALMOST too sensitive, but you quickly adjust to their responsiveness, and the fact that no de-bouncing circuitry is required means that you will never run into the issue of key chatter. That means you are left with an incredibly reliable switch design that will far outlast ANY peripheral that uses a mechanical switch many lifetimes over. The switches also have been designed with a somewhat overkill, but greatly appreciated (no seriously I freaking love this feature), stabilizer system. Every. Single. Switch. is stabilized. It is AMAZING. There is very, very little key cap movement - creating a very solid monolithic feel as if every key was directly attached to the chassis. Each stabilizer has also been individually lubed from the factory using a very, very, good lubricant. The best part is that because the switches have an MX stem you are able to use custom key caps and the larger key stabilizers are removable from the OLD key caps so you can use custom key caps and transplant the special stabs over to your new key caps.Did I mention custom key caps? We have a STANDARD BOTTOM ROW! All custom key cap sets will work. If you ever wanted or needed to replace your caps with something else, you have the entire enthusiast community of key caps to pick from. More and more manufacturers are thankfully starting to do this, and hopefully now that Razer has followed suit, hopefully even more will now as well (COUGH LOGITECH COUGH).The form factor is extraordinarily attractive. Sleek lines, low profile, and attention to detail on every part of the chassis. No gaudy design here, and the only manufacturer logo here is an incredibly subtle Razer logo in a slightly polished aluminium relief right above the nav cluster. It reminds me, very much, like a Massdrop CTRL board with less light everywhere. The black matte design of the chassis keeps the lighting muted, which is personal taste, but I personally very much prefer it. The legends have mostly uniform lighting, but the Function row and some of the larger keys have a little dark spot near the center for most of them. Maybe this can be improved on later designs, but overall it is a huge step in the PBT+POM design for backlit capable PBT keycaps.The only real downsides, and there are two of them, are that the chassis itself is plastic. Yes, there is an aluminium plate on the top, but the vast majority of the chassis is plastic - sturdy well-made plastic, but still plastic. I think a more premium model could be sold with a full aluminium or steel chassis for a higher price that would appeal to many enthusiasts who normally would never look twice at a Razer board, myself included. This really is a matter of preference as the plastic body design does mean that the keyboard is lighter and makes this a really viable travel keyboard option. The only other downside is Synapse, but I am going to preface this by saying that Synapse 3 is MUCH, much improved. It is significantly ahead of both iCUE and G Hub offerings from Corsair and Logitech respectively. But it’s still bloat that really isn\'t needed - and it’s not needed in fact. As far as I can tell, there is nothing that Synapse is required for, so you can safely set up your customizations and then uninstall.Speaking of software customization though, in a pleasant change, every single key is programmable and nothing is locked in. You can, for example, even change function keys to do other things - which also means opening up Hypershift as an option for a variety of macros and functions that you can program directly onto the keyboard itself.In conclusion, this is my new daily driver. Previously, I said I am retiring MY custom builds with Tealios switches that are lubed and dampened. I am surprised at the steps Razer have taken in making a keyboard that even an enthusiast will look twice at. PBT key caps, individually stabilized switches, opto-electric switch design that is far superior to other options out there and equally reliable as something like Hall Effect switches. These switches have the potential for far more interesting features later down the line like full analog key presses and multiple functions per keystroke depending on how far they are pressed. I hope this is a new normal for Razer, and if so - I will put down the soldering iron for a while and continue to support the Razer eco-system. I love the direction you\'re going Razer, and can proudly say I\'m happy to support Razer as a brand again after not having owned a Razer keyboard for over ten years.You guys got this in the bag, and Logitech and Corsair should be shaking in their boots. You\'ve bit back, and bit back hard.','2021-12-19 23:16:55',4,2,229),(573,'  So I\'m not entirely sure how to preface this review, but I\'ll try and say that these are absolutely the most touchy switches I\'ve ever come across. (Which is why I didn\'t rate it very low, since it seems more of a personal preference type of deal)I am used to MX blues and the Razer Greens, so I\'m a fan of tactile and clicky boards / switches. This board\'s Red Optical switches are very tactical and feel awesome when typing. The sound is sorta there, much quieter (but I attribute that to being a red switch) Absolutely awesome to type and game with.Keyboard feels amazing, the keycaps are amazing (in comparision to older boards / cheaper MX boards) that double shot PBT with a slight textured top is so nice on the fingers. Metal top, with a detachable braided C cable makes this such a solid keyboard.My TWO gripes:These are stupid sensitive (again, I chalk that up to a personal preference. I Just can\'t seem to get the hang of them, so I\'m actually returning this board. In favor of a traditional MX switch type). I can literally forget I\'m resting my fingers somewhere when typing and notice I\'ll be typing a bunch of one letter all accidentally. Just because the actuation (assuming that\'s the correct term for it. I\'ve done it a few times while writing this review) It\'s just not for me, but it\'s not a bad thing at all. Playing games, I honestly can\'t believe how fast keys activate. Big props for that, just not for me.Razer Software is ALWAYS a gripe for me, even though I consider myself a fanboy (Headset / Mouse / Keyboard and I own the Razer phone 2) I absolutely hate the software to no end and it\'s 3 iterations. Given my trusty Orochi is not recognized by the Synapse 3 (which this keyboard uses, not sure if it can be used in older iterations) but my trusty mouse cannot be used.Overall, great board for the price. Just TOO touchy for myself.','2021-12-19 23:16:56',4,1,229),(574,'  UPDATE: Razer support has continued to be the worst customer support I have ever received. They have had my keyboard in their warehouse for over 1 month and have still not sent a replacement. I was just reached out to and offered a razer store credit instead because they are “out of stock” even though I bought it through amazon and they are still selling it as in stock through prime.____________________________________________I want to give this product an excellent review, but the colon key does not work after less than a month of using the product with only standard use. The product is still under warranty, but it concerns me greatly that a product quoted as having, \"an industry-leading durability of up to 100 million keystrokes\" has failed within a month.This may be a manufacturing error and I will update the review after Razer sends me a new keyboard that I put some time on.The good features of this product include a 1mm keystroke depth, which has helped ensure that my clicks register on-time while gaming, generally decent rgb lighting and pbt keycaps. Additionally, razer has finally used standard keycaps on all of their keys so you can customize the look of this keyboard with almost any keycaps!','2021-12-19 23:16:57',1,13,229),(575,'  WORKS for Xbox OneTested on CoD and ForniteHeres my thoughts, i just purchase the Razer TE and Viper (works on Xbox one) but i am here to talk about the TE only.  So the keyboard itself is very nice.  To me the RGB doesn\'t have a crazy brightness to it which i personally like.  The cord is a usb and the other end is UsB-C. The cord has a nice thick layer of nylon, very stiff.  The keyboard is mid weight so not very light but built will some quality.  The keys themsleves can be interchangeable but i dont think i will be doing so anytime soon.  I did pull some off to see how it feels.  I do feel like im gonna break it when im pulling it off but if you think it about if it was easy to pull off then it wasnt built right.  Last thing is the sensitivity.  If you have heavy hands/fingers then this is keyboard is not ment for you.  The keys are very sensitive but quickly responsive which i like when gaming.  You dont have to force any pressure when tapping the keys.  The noise really depends on how you press the keys.  If your game is aggressive then yes the noise will be loud and if your playing a MMO then its a soft noise.  To me the noice doesnt bother me at all.  The spacebar is the only key that has a separate sound.  Its alot louder than the other keys when pressing rapidly or aggressively.  Now are there better keyboards out there?, Yes of course.  There was plenty of keyboards i researched but i settled for this one because of the quality, performance and price.  It fits my needs.  So do your research and find your own preferences and hopefully you\'ll find your perfect keyboard.Keyboard length 14\" 1/4Keyboard width 5\" 1/2','2021-12-19 23:16:58',5,4,229),(576,'  I bought this to replace a backlit, but non-RGB tenkeyless mechanical keyboard with this one. My initial reactions were that the spacebar was WAY WAY WAY too loud, the keyboard tactile feedback felt cheap and hollow, and that the backlight was only about half as bright as my non-RGB backlit keyboard.I searched on youtube and found a lot of people who had felt the same way about the loud spacebar sound. I even watched some videos where people had put keyboard o-rings on and reported NO DIFFERENCE. I watched a video where someone put TWO sets of o-rings on the keys and reported NO DIFFERENCE.So... I ordered a set of 40A and 80A orings, and put the 40A on first, then the 80A, and after doing that, I felt that the tactile feedback seemed good and the spacebar sound was acceptably dampened.At this point, I replaced my MAX Blackbird Tenkeyless with my quieted Razer Huntsman. My initial reaction was that the MAX Blackbird is WAY more durable and substantial, and that while RGB is fun, the backlighting on the MAX Blackbird was literally about twice as bright. I debated for a long time about just putting this keyboard in my parts box and keep using my old keyboard.But, I\'d already invested the time and since having RGB keyboard/mouse/mouse pad had been so important to me for some intangible reason, I stuck with it.Aside from the flimsier keycaps, and noisy keys, the opto-mechanical switches are REALLY FAST and I have no complaints about this keyboard for gaming. The downside of this to me is that I\'m finding that I\'m making a LOT more typing errors with this keyboard as the keys are much more sensitive (too sensitive?), but I\'m adapting.I just wish there were a higher end Razer tenkeyless keyboard that felt more substantial, had twice the brightness, and had a purchase option for pudding keycaps (since you can\'t find a set that 100% fits this keyboard).','2021-12-19 23:16:59',3,8,229),(577,'  Was hunting to replace a Razer Blackwidow V2 tournament.

While it\'s not a \"clicky\" keyboard, bottoming out they keys has a very audible thunk.  The V2 is nearly silent.  Second, the keys on this, the V1 of the huntsman feel \"lose\" with a lot of lateral movement that throws off typing and adds additional noise to using it.  The V2 huntsman has no lateral key movement, and no noise because of it.  Finally, the V1 huntsman keys, while feeling light, with the springs having a lot of easy movement, resulting in a lot of misfires when gaming and moving fingers.  The V2 feel hefty, with a good give but a weight that makes it feel solid.I hate, HATE, the V1 huntsman, but absolutely LOVE the V2 huntsman.','2020-09-10 03:00:00',1,10,229),(578,'  Yes yes I get it... a lot of kewbs out there would say their keyboard is way better, way more customizable than this keyboard.

Connection: not a whole lot of custom-made keyboards are wireless but this one is. It also can be use wired with USB-C connection and a storage for your usb dongle when you need to take the keyboard with you for traveling.3. Macro: one of the reason I like 65% keyboard because they do include arrow keys so it worked out great for me who can use this keyboard for goin up and down on my coding homeworks. But one advantage this keyboard also have over the others is the side volume-up and volume-down slider. It is awesome, it does take time to get use to that and it does not seem very sensitive but it better than I have to hit function + other keys for volume.4. Built: custom-made keyboard can be made with multiple different materials: like wood, plastic, aluminum, etc. But this keyboard is already made with seem to be high quality aluminum case and also include a plastic wrap in case you need to take the keyboard somewhere.Overall this keyboard fits everything that I need and I love it.','2021-07-30 04:00:00',5,15,232),(579,'  First of all, its a DUMB keyboard, meaning, you cant save the profile TO THE KEYBOARD, no software, color profile...

Keyboard modifiers: - Fn + Left Alt: triggers Macro registration mode, so if you have to trigger a macro that needs both Fn and Alt modifiers - like Alt + F1 - you need to use the Right Alt in order not to enter the Macro registration mode;- Fn + Right Ctrl: trigger contextual menu, so if you have to trigger a macro that needs both Fn and Ctrl modifiers - like Ctrl + W - you need to use the Left Ctrl in order not to pop up the contextual menu;- to summarise: if you want to trigger Ctrl + Alt + F1, when the Fn-Lk is off, you need to use Left Ctrl + Right Alt + Fn + 1;- this is a smart way to add extra functionality on to the modifiers when used together with Fn, but it gets sometimes difficult to trigger a combination; the alternative is to define Macros for the most used combinations;3.

I retrieved the keycap which fell to the floor and when attempting to fit if back on noticed the stem is still inside the keycap. I have literally only had this \"expensive\" keyboard for 30 days and now it is damaged because the cover wedges itself on and there is no easy way to remove it except to try and pry it off carefully with your fingers. Asus won\'t cover it because according to them their is physical damage, though the damage is as a result of a poorly designed cover that look great. Generally love Asus products which in my experience are well built providing lasting quality, this keyboard is my first experience with Asus in which I had to contact Asus and the service was terrible. I don\'t want my money back I want the board repaired or replaced and I will know better than to use the cover again no matter how nice it looks. But Asus was not going to help me saying upon inspection they would note physical damage which would void the warranty. I did not remove the keycap, it came off with the cover they designed and when it came off it took the stem with it. If it was my fault I would be ok with the consequences but in this case it\'s an expensive lesson to avoid any new products until it is clear there is nothing wrong with the design because Asus is more interested getting my money than keeping me a satisfied customer.Fortunately Amazon (Anthony) was interested in keeping me a happy customer and though the return period ended the day before was willing to send me a replacement. Very happy with Amazon and feel good about the massive amount of money I spend with Amazon. Keep up the great work Amazon, there is a reason you are #1 retailer for my money and many others as well.','2021-03-14 17:00:00',1,6,232),(584,'  Has the ability to shutdown computer which is absolutely idiotic! Windows and other OS\'s already have the ability to put themselves to sleep so why do I need my keyboard to do it? Asus seriously screwed this up. Oh an if you use Linux it is even worse, every time the keyboard sleeps it triggers the computer to log you out on KDE Neon, Manjaro, and Fedora. On Ubuntu it rebooted? Asus ruined a otherwise perfect keyboard. Just an FYI anyone using on linux with x11 run \"xinput | grep keyboard\" to get id of the system control part of the keyboard and then use xinput disable <whatever id number> for example \"xinput disable 19\" that\'s what it is on mine running KDE Neon. Systems running Wayland I\'m not sure of the libinput equivalent to xinput.','2021-01-05 23:30:00',2,9,232),(585,'  I really like this keyboard for what it is. I like the small form factor and the convenience of it being wireless and rechargeable. Wireless is using the 2.4 GHz dongle and not Bluetooth. There is NO Bluetooth. This is fine for me because I\'ve had issues with Bluetooth connectivity. The innovation that was engineered in this keyboard was what also sold me. The interactive touch volume panel and the polycarbonate cover that doubles as a high profile look base that allows the RGB to be diffused in a different way really spoke to me. Doubleshot PBT caps, an aluminum top plate blended with high quality plastics, and the cover provides a perfect balance in weight were it feels premium and not so cheap at the same time. Although this keyboard is geared towards gamers because of the gamer aesthetics and the Cherry MX Red switches, I find it easier for me, in my own experience, to type on this. This whole summary was actually typed using the ROG Falchion at my average speed of 71 WPM with 100% accuracy.','2021-12-19 23:16:49',5,13,232),(586,'  I bought this keyboard both for work and play.  I use it for work during the day, and play games during the night.  It\'s been a couple of months since I got this keyboard, and I love it.  I love the form factor, I love the feel typing with it.  Excellent for gaming.  But with all that said, there is one annoying thing that warrants it to get 3 stars... the RGB lighting.I got this plugged in to my 43 inch Aorus gaming monitor\'s KVM.  When I work, this keyboard controls my work laptop, and when I game it controls my gaming PC via KVM.  The RGB works fine on both computers, but when the computers goes to sleep and/or the screen turns off, the RGB also turns off.  It\'s fine when it turns on when I wake up the computers, but majority of the time the RGB lights won\'t come back on from sleep, and that is annoying.  When I manually lock the desktop, the RGB lights on the keyboard turns off, but when I unlock the desktop, the RGB lights won\'t turn on also.  I thought something may be wrong with the KVM, but I tested the KVM using my Keychron keyboards, and they work fine, which means nothing is wrong with the KVM of the monitor.  In order for the lights to work again, I have to unplug and re-plug the USB cable.  It does the same thing even when in wireless mode.I honestly like this keyboard when the RGB lights are working, and right now just keep on checking if there are new firmware for this keyboard everyday hoping that the annoying sleep bug will be fixed.  So, 3 stars for now.','2021-12-19 23:16:50',3,15,232),(587,'  This keyboard sends a shutdown and sleep code to Linux systems through the HID generic subsystem upon keyboard sleep events.This is problematic for two reasons:1) it renders wireless functionality practically useless on Linux systems.2) it poses security concerns. Simply plugging the keyboard dongle into a susceptible (and potentially critical) system and triggering a sleep event on the keyboard will hard shutdown the computer.I will be RMA\'ing this peripheral and contacting ASUS directly about this firmware bug. I would only consider purchasing this device if you use ONLY Windows systems.','2021-12-19 23:16:51',1,13,232),(588,'            Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n        \n\n\n   EDIT:I bought a GK500 keyboard to have everything syncing but I guess I can only leave one reviewso here\'s a low down of the keyboard which im more impressed withKeyboard Pros:+ excellent blue type of switches, very responsive and tactile, feels great to type on+ great build quality, I especially like the magnetically attached wrist-rest. powerful magnets and can keep them apart too, also no more broken connector tabs (you know what im talking about with those old style palm rests)+ there are so many lighting effects to choose from, you can truly customize it and it syncs well with the mouse although mouse has limited number of light effects so when you sync, there\'s less to choose from+ aluminum face plate, good lighting, good double shot keys+ NKRO, I type pretty fast and sometimes I game even faster and so far I haven\'t noticed any ghosting (I key about avg of 80wpm correctly, up to 120 if some typos are allowed on this)Keyboard minuses:- the key axials arent the tightest and keys can feel a tiny bit wobbly but it hasn\'t really impacted the accuracy or speed of my typing- looks like the software still needs some improvements but I think it is getting there- too bad some of the fancier lighting effects like fireworks or radial don\'t work when synced with mouse-------------------------------------Gaming Mouse Low down:basically a lightweight, ambidextrous mouse that is fast and sensitive for me to get back into gamingI bought it with the GK500 keyboard so I could sync up the lighting effects on my deskfirst thing I noticed is that it comes out kind of reversed out of the box, the left and right mouse buttons are fine, just the forward and backwards browser buttons are on the right side of the mouse instead of the left.so I just needed to download the G-Tools to get it all remappedeasy enough that the G-Tools software also noticed there is a new firmware for the mouse and updated it toothere is one more annoyance though, the g-tools software installed and showed up in French by default but the top right corner has the language selection so it was easy enough to get it into English without me understanding much FrenchThe lighting effects can sync with the keyboard but there is only like 4 types of syncing it can do due to the lack of variation the mouse\'s light effects hasoverall though, it isn\'t easy to find a basic yet high performance ambidextrous mouse these days for gamingand with my son being left handed, this is something he will also be using so I\'m glad it is all working out, with the software and allhe\'s now a 6 years old enjoying watching the light sync up and changing colors with the keyboard on the desk','2021-12-19 23:16:52',5,19,233),(589,'  When the package arrived the box had previously been opened. upon inspection, everything seemed to in working condition and no wear marks. keyboard functions as it is intended to. very clicky.

RGB light is fantastic. You can choose from 4 preset modules or to control by the AOC G-tool app. The thing I loved the most is the wrist rest. It has magnets that snaps into place. Also leather material is really soft and comfortable and I can rest my wrist comfortably. USB Pass-through 2.0 Type-A is useful too. It goes well with the other mouse AGM700 I bought as a set. It only needs to run 1 cable to the PC.This design of the mouse definitely paired with the look of my AOC screen and keyboard.  The color scheme and the tone are very similar to the AGK700 AGON keyboard. I really like the material of the left and right mouse buttons. Some sort of metal-like texture. Adjustable DPI is really convenient too. The only thing I would nic-pick is the adjustable weight. It’s hard to get the weight out from the slot.

Once the macros is on the onboard memory, the macros stored on this mouse can be run on any other computer without having to install any software. It even plays back the time delay recorded between key presses if that feature is desired.Surprisingly a lot of other mice can\'t do this; even ones that cost 3 to 4 times as much. Their on board memory is limited to one/two key assignments per mouse button and require software installation for macros use. Then amongst the mice that don\'t require software installation to playback macros, some of them lose the recorded delays between key presses when playing back the macros if no software is installed.In my search for this mouse, I tried mice from: Logitech, Roccat, Corsair and SteelSeries.','2021-12-19 23:16:55',5,14,233),(592,'  Not happy to have paid for a \"NEW\" keyboard and then recieve an open box return with the shipping lable from the previous reciepent still on the box.

Both my boyfriend and my brother are gamers. My boyfriend has been a gamer for years and is currently customizing his own battle station with RGB lights and all. Whereas, my younger brother just started getting into computer games.My boyfriend was using an HP keyboard for both work and games, but wanted to upgrade to a mechanical keyboard. He was looking at a few Razer keyboards, but it was too expensive. Considering the price, I thought the AGON set would be a great gift to complete his setup. My boyfriend was super ecstatic when I gave it to him. So far, he loves how it feels when he types and how fast it registers. When I tried it out myself, typing felt amazing. Now I understand why people love mechanical keyboards so much. My boyfriend uses the memory profiles the most because he’s constantly switching between games with his friends and the media keys because he plays a ton of music while he plays. It’s also pretty hefty so the keyboard doesn’t move around so much when he’s playing. The keyboard lights are super pretty when the lights are dimmed low. His only complaint is that there aren’t many light effects. The mouse is super fast compared to his old Logitech wireless mouse that he\'s had for some time. It also comes with these small weights at the bottom of the mouse that you can adjust based on your weight preferences, which I thought was a nifty feature. Overall, he’s super happy with his keyboard and mouse set.My little brother just started gaming last summer using some computer hand-me-downs from friends and family. I promised him that if he got good grades over the year, I\'d get him a new keyboard and he passed the school year with flying colors. He was so excited for his first gaming keyboard, when it arrived and he plugged it into his computer immediately. It\'s a really good size for him and it\'s lightweight enough for him to bring it with him when he goes over to his friend\'s house. He also likes how there\'s a wrist rest for when his hands get tired during online classes or when he\'s writing an essay for homework. He loves how the RGB lights light up his desk area and makes it easier for him to see when he\'s typing.TL;DR: Both my boyfriend and my younger brother love their new gaming accessories!','2021-07-30 04:00:00',5,14,233),(598,'  \"Take a step away from membrane keyboards!\" they said.\"You\'ll enjoy it!\" they said.I did. Until I didn\'t.See, for the most part, I love it; mine\'s got the HyperX Red switches, and they feel really nice, other than I would\'ve liked a little less resistance on the keypress for typing and stuff. The RGB is pretty, the keys are stabilized well, overall the keyboard made the first two weeks very pleasant. And then the problems began.At first it was minor, one press in ten, the \'c\' key wouldn\'t actually register. Then one time in 5, then one in 2, and then it would take several keypresses to actually get it to register. \"Surely the switch has failed.\" I thought. So, I rang up HyperX support, and they had me troubleshoot the issue, and lo and behold, it\'s a simple fix, a driver update via their NGENUITY software. Great, easy enough, except many people start getting a sinking feeling when you talk about peripheral hardware and driver failure in the same sentence.Fast forward a month or so, and all of the sudden, I press the \'m\' key, only to have nothing happen. I press it again; it works. A fluke? No, now it only gets one in ten presses, if that. Alright, I\'ll just update the drivers again right? WRONG. Because now NGENUITY can\'t see the keyboard. Restart? Replug? Nothing works. Alright then, uninstall NGENUITY and everything will work great, surely? As it turns out, this is just one layer of the failure onion that HyperX, a generally reputable division of Kingston, has created.So let\'s approach this layer by layer. First off, we have keys randomly failing due to driver issues. This begs the question of what the he** the drivers are doing that individual keys can fail and leave all other functionality unaffected. What is going on under the hood that permits this. Then we have the NGENUITY software, which at first glance, isn\'t all that bad. It\'s at second and third glance that it gets really bad. Now we have another key failure, but now NGENUITY can\'t tell the keyboard is there. The logical option is to reinstall, but HyperX decided, in their infinite wisdom, \"Hey, let\'s make this install exclusively through the Microsoft Store. That definitely won\'t make the software a complete pain to troubleshoot.\". Well, funny story, you can uninstall it, but thanks to Microsoft\'s garbage \"store\" software, it, in my case at least, cannot be reinstalled. It just throws error 0x80073D05 ad infinitum.Normally, if you uninstalled something and then couldn\'t reinstall it, you\'d just purge every mention of it in your filesystem right? Well in this case, you can\'t. Store apps are kept in a hidden file that it appears even administrator accounts can no longer grant themselves access to, so as much as I\'d like to simply purge everything associated with this software and have another go, I can\'t. Even if NGENUITY worked, I wouldn\'t have a way to install it. So now I have a keyboard that has, in my definition, failed. Keypresses go in, letters come out. If letters don\'t come out, the keyboard has failed.Somehow, HyperX has made great hardware, then kneecapped it with awful software that installs through a worse platform. I\'d love this keyboard, but it doesn\'t work, and I can\'t even blame the keyboard for it. Hardware failures I can understand, a certain number of units are going to be DOA, that\'s life, but software rendering hardware unusable? That\'s just sheer incompetence, nothing less, especially when you\'re pushing unstable versions of software to customers who already have the hardware, which then renders it unusable.This has really degraded my confidence in HyperX as a whole, and just as Razer\'s DeathAdder and Logitech\'s G502 left a bad taste in my mouth over their hardware (thus, leading to me looking elsewhere for a new keyboard), HyperX has demonstrated an egregious level of incompetence I\'ve never encountered.','2021-12-19 23:16:54',1,2,237),(599,'  Do not hit the “Add to Cart” button until you read this review!  This is an honest review based on my own personal experience using the HyperX Alloy Origins Core keyboard for more than two months.  Do not get me wrong, overall, it is a really good keyboard, however, I think it’s worth noting its pluses as well as its problems before you make your final decision and hit the “Add to Cart” button.  This keyboard has a lot of functionality; however, it also has a few issues.There are definitely many pros for the HyperX keyboard.  In my opinion, it has a lot of functionality and is clearly worth the price.  First, the LED lights on this keyboard are really cool!  They are individually controlled and allow you to easily change the lighting effects.  And believe me, when I say it, these lights are much nicer than you would expect.  It is as if you have your own personal mini light show!  Second, the more compact Tenkeyless (TKL) size fits nicely on my desk and gives me significantly more room to work with.  That means less mess!  Woohoo!  I would highly recommend this keyboard to anyone who likes the TKL style.  Third, the tactile aqua switches are also really nice.  Additionally, on the issue of whether you want linear or tactile switches, that will be entirely up to your personal preference.  However, a general rule of thumb that I use is if you will be typing documents and gaming get tactile, and if you are just going to use it for gaming only, get linear.  Fourth, the all-aluminum body design is sturdier than most keyboards.  Fifth, because HyperX frequently updates their software, it provides the user with the latest new features.  Sixth, if you are coming from a non-mechanical keyboard it will take some getting used to at first because of the difference in actuation time.  However, once you get used to this, it is hard to go back to a non-mechanical keyboard due to all the benefits that come with a mechanical keyboard. Basically, the mechanical keyboard has a better feel to it and is easier to work with than other keyboards.  Finally, the removable USB plug is a great feature since it allows you to use custom USB cables for that extra bit of aesthetics.Now for the cons of the HyperX keyboard.  The first issue I found was the lack of onboard memory for key trigger effects, however, this has since been fixed.  Second, the lack of dedicated media keys was extremely difficult to get used to.  In my opinion, this keyboard could be improved by adding media keys.  Finally, the NGenuity software kind of sucks!  Specifically, during the automatic software updates, it sometimes removes features that you like and want to keep.  As a result, just when you get used to a specific feature and without any warning, NGenuity removes it.  Basically, the software is slightly difficult to work with, although it does get the job done.  Bottom line, the software is definitely not perfect and could be a bit more intuitive.  As you can see, the HyperX keyboard has many more pros than cons that should be considered before you hit the “Add to Cart” button.  Overall, the keyboard is very good, and I will continue to use it as my main keyboard.  For the price, it does it all with a nice compact design to keep your desk clean and uncluttered.  If you are looking for a new keyboard, I would suggest taking a look at this one, however, don’t take my word for it, look at all the other reviews online.  I hope you found this review helpful.  This keyboard has a lot of functionality; however, it also has a few issues to consider before you hit the “Add to Cart” button.','2019-11-18 14:15:00',4,6,237),(600,'  I\'ve owned quite a few keyboards and especially mechanical keyboards. After my wife took my Logitech G512, my favorite keyboard except that it\'s not TKL, I needed to find another board. I\'ve used HyperX gear before, I have their headset and love it, so I figured I would give this a shot. I agonized over the specs of the this board vs the G512, Razer huntsman TE and others. On paper these switches are not as quick and have more travel then the other two options. However, in real world use you don\'t really notice the difference. The linear switches are very smooth and the overall bottom out sound is not too loud. I would say the G 512 is a tad bit quieter. There is vertually no wobble with the keys either, which is something from the 512 I really came to like. The RGB color is nice and clear, better than the G512. The software is super easy to use and seems to be nice and light weight. Plus you can save three profiles right to the board which my G512 couldn\'t do. Overall very happy with my purchase.','2021-12-05 15:29:15',5,5,237),(601,'  Firstly, let me start by saying that I got the Origins Core ten keyless with aqua switches. My first impressions out of the box were, if I were to sum it up, I was simply blown away. I buy keyboards around this price because it\'s usually not a big deal for me as long as the switches are good, it has good build quality, and the reviews are good. This is my first keyboard made from aluminum alloy and it looks and feels incredible. The pictures do not do this keyboard justice. Not to mention, the RGB is phenomenal and looks so clean. For $80, alone, the deck and rgb are two solid features that would make me buy this again if I had to. By far my most anticipated feature while waiting for this to arrive were the aqua switches. I can\'t really describe the feel because it is something you have to try fopr yourself. However, I will say that they feel mostly tactile but ever so slightly linear. But oh man, let me tell you, they feel so good when typing and playing. Think of cherry mx reds mixed with brown switches that also has a nice cushion and beautiful sound with each click. In short, I am extremely satisfied with this product and would go out and buy it again if something happened. Also, I replaced my keycaps with hyperx pbt doubleshot pudding caps.','2017-08-09 09:00:00',5,20,237),(602,'  This is a tremendous value for what you get with this keyboard.Pros-linear custom switches-these are pretty much custom Cherry switches with a few tweaks by Kingston-usb type C-full alloy construction on bottom and top-beautiful bright RGB-super satisfying clicks-I knew these weren\'t silent, I have not used a cherry switch keyboard that is. To me this is a pro because I want to hear those clicks.-this adjusts in 2 stages of height and the feet are super sturdy-no flex on this board. This could be used as a weapon lol.-price is super good for this as a entry level mechanical and its really much better than other brands....not saying names here.-you can replace the keycaps easily and I would suggest if your spending nearly 100 look into HyperX PBT keycaps in white or black. I chosen black because they look sick without RGB on and the bottoms are white which lets the glow come out.-TKL (tenkeyless) is amazing and I am sold on it now-problems others report I have not had. I have tested this keyboard with frequent use for the last week and no double registered keys. That could be a possible USB problem or cable problem and or motherboard problem and possibly not the keyboards fault.Cons:-software seems slightly limited, but Ngenuity is in beta, so I forgive them and I know it will improve.-keycaps that come with this board are super thin and cheap. If you have already invested this much, you might as well spend a little more and make this type a bit better with better looking and functioning keycaps. PBT doubleshots are thicker and have a better curve which helps for gaming and typing for me.Overall, I only had 2 cons with my review. I don\'t think there is anything out there with this much quality build and function for the price. You can go cheaper, but you get what you pay for. Happy gaming!','2021-03-14 17:00:00',5,19,237),(603,'  I\'ve only had the keyboard for a couple of weeks but so far I like it better than the broken 2 year old Corsair K70 it replaces. The tenkeyless keyboard I purchased has more weight than the full size K70 and as a result stays put when gaming. The key strokes are smooth and not excessively loud. With the ability to save three profiles to the keyboard I do not need to keep any control software running in order to keep my current color scheme or select an alternate. For the more sophisticated user the NGENUITY software allows for additional profiles.  I found the HyperX NGENUITY  software to be easier and more intuitive to use than iCUE. The complaint that people needed a HyperX id to use it has been corrected in the latest so a user can log in as a guest. If I were to have one improvement that would be to add a pass-through USB port to the backside. All in all I am satisfied with the keyboard and supporting software.','2021-01-05 23:30:00',5,5,237),(604,'  I really liked the keyboard the first 5 months I owned it.

I originally bought the \"Redragon K556\" Keyboard but returned it because it was not bright enough for me. I read reviews about how bright the \"HyperX Alloy Origins\" Keyboard can get and that is the reason I purchased this one and I\'m glad I did. I also like how it uses a C Cable to attach to the keyboard rather than the cord being hardwired.The only thing I don\'t like about the \"HyperX Alloy Origins\" Keyboard is the location where the cable connects to the keyboard. I like cable management and to hide as many cables as I can. I drilled a hole in my desk and ran the cable through my desk, however, I can still see a little bit of the cord because it attaches to the back right of the keyboard (See Second Image).I looked online for a right angle C Cable and I found the “Anker 180 Degree Right Angle USB A to USB C Gaming Cord” (See First Link Below).I also purchased a USB 3.0 Extension Cable (See Second Link Below).https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SNS51RK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psp=1https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B088GSJLWX/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psp=1The “Anker 180 Degree Right Angle Cord” is perfect for this keyboard and hides the cord well! (See First Image). The cord is only 3 ft. long so I had to purchase a USB 3.0 Extension Cable so it could reach my PC.  Also, the Right Angle Cord is a little tight so you have to push in a little to connect it to the keyboard, but it works.I wish these keyboard manufactures would connect the cable to the bottom of the keyboard for better cable management. I know a lot of gamers out there also prefer to hide their cables and also drill holes in their desk for better cable management, so I think HyperX should consider updating their design. I am happy to have found a cable management solution with the \"Anker 180 Degree Right Angle USB A to USB C Gaming Cord”.Hope this review helps some people.','2021-12-19 23:16:50',5,2,237),(606,'            Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n        \n\n\n   I picked this up to use across two systems as I recently started using a docked laptop as my daily driver.  The usb-c connection makes swapping between systems as simple as swapping a single cable, meanwhile I can tuck the other cable away when not in use.  This is replacing the alloy elite and this is my experience so far ...Been using this board since late Feb 2021 and I love it.  It has a much smaller footprint than the alloy elite while boasting pretty much all of the same features.  At first the removal of the dedicated media keys, volume roller, and dedicated RGB keys was bothering me, but all of these functions are mapped to the function keys on this board.  Not having those keys is actually the big thing I love about this board.  It offers the same hyper x clicky switches that I love in a much more compact form factor.The build quality is great.  The deck is all metal and super slim compared to the alloy elite as well as every other board I\'ve used in the past.  It\'s close to logitech\'s offerings as far as thinness goes, but without the extreme flex and terrible keycaps.  The hyper x keycaps use standard mx stems so using pretty much any keycap set should fit these, though check the questions if you\'re looking for specific compatibility.I removed the pudding keycaps from my alloy elite and swapped them over to these which ... is a mixed bag.  Overall I love the floating keycap design and the backlighting on this thing is both very bright and software accurate.  I do miss the the legends printed on the FN keys that tell me which keys do what since I no longer have the dedicated media keys, but it took approximately a day to remember everything.  Compared to the alloy elite this board seems much brighter overall.  The lowest setting on these switches seems to be brighter than the highest setting on the elite, which could be a placebo effect but I don\'t know.  I can\'t turn these up to max without it being painful to keep in my periphery.  So RGB?? Fantastic on this board, especially with the pudding keycaps.I also really like the adjustable feet that offers you 3 different height adjustments.  It\'s pretty standard these days but I still love to see it.Another thing I love is the numlock/caps lock display.  It\'s positioned perfectly so that you can easily see at a glance which functions you have activated.  This was not the case on the alloy elite.  The display was placed too closely to the numpad meaning that unless you were sitting up very straight, are super tall, or leaned forward to look at it you could NOT tell what was on/off.  This is a big improvement.  It seems minor but it really bugged me on the elite.Not much else to say.  Keycaps feel great, very stable and it has that satisfying bump I\'m looking for in an mx-blue style switch.  i love it.So everything about this keyboard is amazing, but it right now!! ... oh wait ... the softwareWell the software is pretty barebones, isn\'t very streamlined, and still appears to be in beta from the MS store?  I\'m not sure as I didn\'t install this on the computer I\'m using right now.  I used my old pc (desktop) to set this up since it already had the hyperx software (ngenuity i believe)  installed, and it works well enough.  While the colors of the keycaps are very accurate in terms of how close they are to what you see in the software you would not notice this with the stock keycaps.  The black seems to shift the colors just a little bit so that they appear darker.  With the pudding keycaps though they\'re amazing.  Can\'t complain here.  So yeah use the software once to customize your board, then uninstall it.  There are plenty of effects to choose from whether you prefer static colors or moving effects ... it all looks great.And with that yeah I think we\'re done.  This is a fantastic keyboard for anyone looking for a better overall typing experience.  Do some research about switches, maybe order a sample pack of switches or something, to find the one that\'s right from you, then go  nuts.  Great product, will definitely be buying hyper x again if they can maintain this level of quality and value.  Good stuff','2021-12-19 23:16:51',5,7,237),(607,'  Let me make this clear: the NGENUITY software is perhaps the worst piece of software I have ever seen. It refuses to connect to my keyboard, even after following every (limited) piece of troubleshooting available in my search results. The only thing that kind of worked was a fresh install of Windows 10, and even then after reinstalling my other apps, it broke again. I don\'t know which of my apps is conflicting, but it\'s not on their official list of problem apps, and I\'m not going to uninstall my other programs just to get this piece of junk program to work.I cannot recommend you buy this keyboard if you like to change your lights regularly.That being said, if you don\'t plan on changing the colors much, the keyboard itself is fantastic, the best I\'ve ever had for its price. Amazing value for under $100 (I got the TKL version). It feels and looks amazing, better than my Corsair that was over twice the price. So, if you only ever plan on changing the colors once or twice and leaving it alone after that, I can recommend it.','2021-12-19 23:16:52',3,7,237),(608,'  My experience with Asus software would be similar as if you were walking early in the morning to pick up your newspaper and suddenly stepping on dog crap and slipping on it and getting on your self everywhere including your eyes, you would not just be angry but feel full of wrath.  It took about 6 hours just to get the software to install.  Apparently if you had previously Asus product and you uninstalled the software it leaves crap behind which required you to learn how to remove Asus services using command prompt, deleting anything related to asus on c drive and removing registries just to get the software to install.After spending 6 hours getting software to install, then you are stuck at a loading screen, after a while you spend another two hours just to get the keyboard and software to update.  I though logitech and Razer was bad, but this is at a whole new level.Here are the pros:1. Detachable keypad2. Wrist rest3. Magnets on the rest rest, but it would have been nice to have option to screw it in as well so that keyboard can be picked up by it4.  Soft wrist rest - however I would have preferred plastic for ease of cleaning and durability5. Optical switches, most smoothest switches that I have typed on, they feel as good as Cherry MX Reds6. Volume roller, high quality better than any other keyboards that I had in the past7. Battery seems to be good, but I have not had this keyboard for long to know for sure8. RGB on keycaps even on Fn fuctionsCons:1. Software, very buggy, difficult to install, overuse of minimalism (you need to be click idiot to determine if it has action or not)2. Key caps, the choose of font is childish, they should have chosen a professional font3. ABS material of key caps, at this price range double shot PBT should have been minimum4. I noticed my keyboard stated to reset it self, lights would turn on and then off and number pad num lock needed to be turn on again and again.  When I was in the middle of writing something, it happened that the keyboard reset it self and started to type by it self and repeating causing the report that I was writing to crash on me and I lost my work.  I think it has to do with detachable keypad poor contacts.5.  Keyboard keypad attachment is very flimsy6.  Proprietary key switches, it would have been better if they have used cherry mx style key cap switches so that people could choose to use their key caps or not','2021-12-19 23:16:53',2,5,242),(609,'  Update: I\'m going to return this because about a week after my review, the board rapidly connects and disconnects at very random times. I\'ve tried all my other USB ports, different cables, kept checking for firmware updates. Everything within reason because I really don\'t want to return this board, but that\'s just an issue you don\'t want in the middle of anything. Sometimes it\'ll work a day or two flawlessly, then while gaming, it will start disconnecting and connecting for about 20-30 seconds and I\'m just not willing to accept that for how expensive this keyboard is. It\'s a real shame too because this is absolutely my favorite gaming keyboard that I\'ve tried so far. The build quality is fantastic, and I really like how their linear Optical RX switches feel. By far my favorite switch, even over some of the lubed switches I\'ve tried, but this random glitch is simply unacceptable. I recommend avoiding this until you see signs that they\'ve addressed this issue directly.','2021-12-19 23:16:54',2,17,242),(610,'  So there are a few things to note:#1. This is expensive for a keyboard. Is it 300$ good? That\'s debatable. I find these keys to be butter smooth. As a typing keyboard, there is no sound and the keys feel so good to press. And a gaming keyboard, literally perfect. No issues with key placement and it has all the bells and whistles I want.#2. You CANNOT get keycaps for this. It has a special type of key, so you cannot hot swap them for some puddings or doubleshots because they won\'t work. Hopefully ROG will make variations for users.#3. I would get another hand rest for this item if you plan on going TKL, because the hand rest they give you is a full size. I already got a razer TKL hand rest and it does fit perfectly.At the end of the day, if you already have a gaming keyboard and cannot justify the price tag, don\'t get it. Its not game changing or revolutionary. For me, I have a hard on for ROG products and am collecting as much as I can, so I really do like this keyboard a lot. Would recommend for anyone not put off by the price.','2021-12-19 23:16:55',5,14,242),(611,'  Really nice Keyboard with great features.

So when the keyboard arrives, I plug it into my PC and has no problem with it(Or maybe the problem hasn\'t arise yet). After several hours of usage I decided to install Armor Crate and update the firmware as in the manual. After the firmware update and the next couple days I notice some serious driver issues with the keyboard.First issue keyboard will mess with my mouse from time to time. It is as if it\'s drawing not enough current from the USB 3.0 port. From time to time it will cut off for a second and come back. So both mouse and keyboard stops working from time to time.Then there is another issue of the key I type start repeating itself without me doing anything. Try to google \"Rog claymore ii issues part 2\" and you will find a video post by a user. I have the exact same problem, and it\'s a common problem, not acceptable for a 200 pounds keyboard.I went to the asus forum to find a solution. Surprisingly a lot of people are having problem with the firmware upgrade, and asked to downgrade the firmware, but that is not possible. In the end I gave up and asked for a refund. After all the research I\'ve done, my conclusion is ASUS make good hardwares like motherboard and graphic cards, but their peripherals is trash, avoid it.','2021-07-30 04:00:00',1,20,242),(617,'  This is another high quality ROG product. A nice addition to my gaming setup. The ten key pad is detachable which is a nice feature. Fast charging capability for wireless use. Connect it via the USB cable for the best performance.','2021-12-19 23:16:54',5,13,242),(618,'  This keyboard is very well built and sturdy. Cherry MX switches are the gold standard in keyboards and perform amazing. I elected to get the Cherry MX reds. The RGB looks stunning and is so smooth if your into such. The keyboard has slot of functions as well that work flawlessly. The sound of each key is smooth and crisp. These Cherry MX switches are the same Cherry MX switches that are in all other boards. Identical switches from the same company. Overall I would put this keyboard on par with the Huntsman TKL or any other top TKL keyboard. You won’t go wrong with it.','2019-11-18 14:15:00',5,18,243),(619,'  I am a serious Overwatch Player.  I bought this keyboard specifically for my gaming setup.  It is great.  The MX brown switches are pefect.  The TKL size is great and gives you a lot more room for your mouse to swing around at low DPI.  The build quality is exactly what you expect from ROG.  The extra large Ctrl button is GREAT for crouching.  All in all the best FPS gaming keyboard for the money.  Compared to the Strix Flare I use as my everyday this thing is tiny.  Key spacing is the same, just a much smaller frame.  Not sure it would be great for a daily driver but for gaming there is none better.  I do wish it came with an integrated wrist rest, or even one you could buy that would magnetically snap on but not a big deal.  Side not the F12 button function that allows you to mute and minimize everything is great.','2021-12-05 15:29:15',5,19,243),(620,'  I\'m going to preface this review by saying that my last couple of keyboards have been enthusiast board, so I was going to be hard to please in this regard. I decided to try this after rebuilding my personal PC with Asus Rog parts and thought it would be fun to be able to sync all of the RGB together, and to my delight it worked!The board is great at doing that. The entire setup syncs together with the Aura sync app and adds a great feel to my desk. This is also genuinely one of the comfiest keyboards I\'ve ever had the pleasure of typing on (I chose MX Reds) . I was super excited to try the retooled cherry switches and see how they felt. I\'m pleasantly impressed. In that regard the board really succeeds.My issue, however is with the build quality of the board itself. The first one I received had extremely sticky switches on the Ctrl, shift, and enter keys. In addition: I discovered that when plugged in I can hear a high pitched whine coming through my headphones. Lastly: plugging the thing in proved to be a real pain, as the housing around USB C cable that it comes with seems to be slightly too large for the port itself. It took me a solid few minutes to understand how to plug this thing in so it gets the right contact points.  I eventually decided to give it the benefit of the doubt and RMA it and receive a new one, maybe I had a bad unit.The second one is better, but still had at least one sticky key that I had to repair myself, and *still* produces the whining noise if my headphones aren\'t playing any sound. After tinkering around with it, I finally discovered that this was due to the DAC amp that I had plugged in via USB, as plugging headphones directly into the motherboard did not reproduce the issue. But, honestly, the fact that no other keyboard I own  does this speaks more to the board\'s engineering than it does to the setup.I\'m disappointed, mostly because I really REALLY wanted to like this board. It almost ticks all the right boxes for me, but the fact that I had to do so much tinkering and fixing just to make the thing work as a basic functional keyboard for my work-from-home setup makes me feel like even for the sale price of $109 that I received it for doesn\'t even feel worth it.Feels great while you\'re gaming, though.','2017-08-09 09:00:00',2,16,243),(621,'  Premium packaging and premium feeling keyboard with good weight to it. However, for the price, the spacebar rattles when you type and also the RGB wave that is made in one of the RGB modes is choppy. I feel like at this price point, they could\'ve done a better job, especially when a cheaper alternative like RK Pro packs more functionality and is more refined.However, this keyboard does have slightly grippier textured keys. If you like that it\'s great, but to me, that doesn\'t really matter. I feel like it would slow me down a bit when typing, but one can argue it gives better control when gaming? Although I\'ve never had mis-clicks with normal textured or even slippery textured keycaps.The dealbreaker for me is, the windows key is smaller than standard size, because they enlarged the control key. I need to use this keyboard to code on Mac/Linux, and the window key turns into the command key on Mac, so I need it to be at least normal size, preferably a bit bigger. When I say small, I mean the window key is smaller than even the Z key right above it. Kinda boggles the mind that they would pay extra to have that manufactured and have an extra part in the assembly line just for that. That I think is where your money went if you paid for the keyboard.If you ONLY use this keyboard for gaming, I can see this being a good premium choice, if the spacebar rattle doesn\'t bother you, or if you in fact like it. If you need to use it with Mac too then forget it. Even if you use it for normal productivity on Windows, I would think the smaller windows key will bother you at some point.FYI I needed to use this keyboard for work, typing chats and emails, coding on Mac/linux, and gaming on PC.P.S. They do use genuine MX Cherry switches. I checked by pulling of one keycap and the switch is indeed MX Cherry branded. In my mind, MX Cherry is the best mass produced keyboard switches. You can go boutique with proprietary switches like Logitech, but then you are going to pay a lot more.','2021-03-14 17:00:00',4,4,243),(622,'  The Keyboard itself is pretty good. I was mostly looking for a keyboard with rgb all the way around the switch unlike what I had with my huntsman elite and I also like the aesthetic look of ROG it\'s just a shame it\'s tied to Armory crate and aura because my goodness my experience with it over a few different products is garbage. I know people have different experiences and some say it\'s good and ICUE or Gigabytes software is bad but it just doesn\'t work most of the time for me. It either freezes the rgb after a few minutes or skips frame by frame instead of a smooth transition in color and even if it does stay working it won\'t the next time I boot my pc. The only temporary fix I had was to turn the performance mode or whatever it is on and off in the settings and again this only lasted for like 2 minutes. The saving grace for all of this is Asus allows you to change the rgb on the keyboard itself without any software but if you have an Asus mouse too kiss customization goodbye for the mouse without the software. It\'s really a shame because I wanted to get an ROG motherboard too but until they fix their software I\'m good lol.','2021-01-05 23:30:00',4,15,243),(623,'  The keyboard itself is built very nicely but having the bright rgb and getting a speck of dust on it, it shows up like crazy because of the metal plate color. The stabilizers are good expect on the space bar they have a rattle and ping like you’d get from a Corsair keyboard which isn’t a good thing. Two main issues the control key is 2u which is bad for Warzone especially when you ping a enemy you end up hitting the windows key instead of alt because the bottom row isn’t standard. The second issue is. After going through armory crate and updating the firmware the rgb sync either flickers intermittently and or just doesn’t sync anymore. Overall this could have been a decent prebuilt bored but after owning and still owning a ducky shine mini the original one and a couple Varmilo keyboards there’s no going back to box store brands. I have an asus mobo which is amazing but I got this keyboard and the newer mouse with the analog stick and they were both a big disappointment in the end.','2021-12-19 23:16:49',3,20,243),(624,'  I am old school - learned to type on an IBM Selectric, then the IBM PC (the original) in college.  I\'ve been wanting a old school keyboard for some time and decided to try the TKL with Cherry Brown switches.  It is good.  I would like a bit more feedback at the top, but it is good enough.  I don\'t miss the \"click\", typing fast on this keyboard makes enough clicky noises as the keys bottom out anyway.Size is good, the weight of the keyboard was surprisingly heavy - a good thing in my opinion.  More that adequate rubber feet to keep it from moving around; in fact, you have to pick it up and put it where you want it. It does not slide well at all.A couple of things to note, mine did not come with a palm rest and as I get lazy, my outer left palm tends to start laying on the CTRL key and I sometimes get weird things happening as the CTRL gets pressed with whatever else I\'m typing.  Considering a palm rest to see if that helps.  The Ten Key Less format is pretty compact - laptop sized.  I am wondering if the keys are slightly pushed together...feels a little cramped sometimes.  I am seriously considering getting another of the series, but in the full size to hopefully have a little more spacing.','2021-12-19 23:16:50',4,18,243),(625,'  Great tkl keyboard. Its well built and connects via usb c.  Out of the box it has a few rgb schemes but I just keep it a solid white color.The only issue is the software. It\'s kind of cumbersome, so unintsalled it.  You dont need it unless you want to do custom rgb color schemes.I would buy another one if it came in white to match my other devices.','2021-12-19 23:16:51',5,4,243),(626,'  So honestly this is a really, well-made keyboard and it probably does everything that it says on the tin. But I\'m typing this review on my old redragon because the included ASUS type C cable (has their logo on it & everything) DOESN\'T ACTUALLY FIT INTO THE KEYBOARD. (See pictures) My bulkier USB 3.0 > C Anker cable also didn\'t fit, only smaller (likely phone cables with miniature plug housing.Now I\'m guessing (hoping) that this is a defective unit & either the actual USB C female socket has the plug abnormally far recessed into the keyboard housing so it can\'t reach the actual plug. Or the socket housing is abnormally small.Edit: Got a replacement unit. This one fits but the cable is a super snug. It might have been on me, but I don\'t know what was up with the first cable. Armory crate software is super buggy after struggling with it for a week. & The Music to keyboard lighting isn\'t the best (not a lot of options & again, buggy) but the build for the keyboard is solid.','2021-12-19 23:16:52',4,11,243),(627,'  I like the mechanical keys, the durable and rugged base, the small footprint, the addressable lights. The small size means it is really easy to adjust as I use multiple elements in my home office. It also saves space for my large mouse pad. I can use two mice on a single mouse pad, because I got this smaller keyboard.Yes, I would buy again. I would recommend it to others.','2021-12-19 23:16:53',5,11,243),(628,'  If you don\'t have a Asus setup and just want a high quality keyboard for gaming, I would probably go with the Corsair K95 Platinum. However, if you are like me and want to match the rest of your hardware, this isn\'t a bad choice.The lighting, if you are into that kind of thing, is really good. Several choices on lighting effects, however I stick with \"static\". Build quality is pretty good and it feels solid. One thing I have a problem with is the lack of bumps to find the S key when gaming. It\'s marketed as a gaming keyboard but the only location bumps on the key caps are on the F and J keys which are the standards for finding \'home row\' when typing. They need to add a \'bump\' on the S key so you can more easily locate WASD while gaming. In addition, the wrist rest doesn\'t really snap to the keyboard and if you pick it up to move it, it\'s going to fall off. Not a big deal to most people I would imagine, but worth a mention.I wish this keyboard had a row of macro assigned keys like the K95, but Asus kept the keyboard smaller by not adding them. Maybe not enough people use this, I\'m not sure. This keyboard does not come with a key cap puller for easy cleaning. This is something that the K95 comes with and is the kind of attention to detail that Asus all too often miss with their peripherals (Claymore wrist rest anyone?). For the premium price, I expect attention to detail and perks.As of right now the biggest miss for me is the software, I did not change my rating based on the software, as this is supposed to be a review of the keyboard, and to me, the keyboard is a 4 out of 5. The software would probably be a 2 or 3 out of 5. There is a lot of room for improvement. Right now if you want to enabled a profile for a particular game, i.e. changing certain important key cap colors such as WASD, etc, that can be done by linking the profile to a exe. The problem is, as far as I know, there is no easy way to switch back to a default profile once you shut the game down. Because of this, you have to open Armoury II and manually click back to your default profile. How that hasn\'t been addressed at this point I\'m not sure.To sum up, solid keyboard missing some details and perks you\'d expect for the amount of money you pay. Software needs improvement as it\'s not good enough yet.','2021-12-19 23:16:54',4,20,244),(629,'  My last two keyboards have been Corsair boards (K55 and K70 Rapidfire). I had significant software and firmware issues with these boards, including but not limited to infinite key ghosting, randomly disconnecting every connected USB device, and causing lockups when connecting and disconnecting controllers and similar devices. I also hated the Cherry MX Speed switches I had on the K70, too little actuation force and distance, far too linear, and typing felt really mushy (would also hit lots of other keys because of how odd the Speed switches are). And for a $150 keyboard, the K70 was definitely not worth it (doesn\'t even have on board memory!). Not to mention, the iCUE software is very bad. You can do a lot of cool lighting effects with it, but the UI is ugly and it is very clunky. Some things like profile switching and adding macros to new profiles is very annoying and is really time consuming (often times profiles would randomly switch on their own when tabbing through various open programs).Queue the ROG Strix Flare. After being pissed at how bad my last few keyboards were I definitely didn\'t want to get another Corsair one. I\'ve been a fan of Asus products for some time, with most of my PC being made out of ROG components and having a Zenfone; so I naturally went to see what Asus had to offer. The Claymore looks really nice, but its quite expensive and doesn\'t come with a wrist rest (from what I\'ve seen), so I looked for other options. The Cerberus is a membrane board, and isn\'t RGB; but its cheap. I saw the Flare crop up in Amazon and it looked pretty good. I went and watched a couple reviews for it and was sold. I chose the MX Brown model.Unboxing the Strix Flare was really nice. The keyboard was wrapped in cloth and, as per usual, the actual box itself was well designed and very simplistic. I went and got the ROG Armoury II software; which has less customization than Corsair\'s, but the UI is nicer and works far better. The Brown switches were immediately different from the Speed switches. I can rest my hand on the keys without accidentally inputting a bunch of random characters, and the feel of pressing the key is much more responsive thanks to the tactile bump. The heavier actuation force and farther actuation distance makes typing much more enjoyable. I no longer accidentally press wrong or extra keys, and the keycaps feel nicer under my fingers.The board itself looks more simplistic than the K70, and it feels nicer despite being made out of plastic. The RGB elements are done better imo, and the under-glow on the sides is cool. The media keys are easier to reach because they aren\'t hidden behind tall keycaps anymore, I would prefer them to be above the numpad, but I think the trade-off is acceptable. The volume nob is larger and feels better when you roll it. There is no volume mute button, which is kind of unfortunate, but at least there\'s media keys. I don\'t feel like the Windows lock button is necessary, but I\'ve rarely used them before, so maybe its nice for someone else. Actually having on-the-fly macro recording is nice as well (if it was on the K70 I never knew how to use it). The wrist rest feels nice, despite not being padded. However I think they cut back here, the wrist rest does not seem to actually attach to the board, not even with magnets. I just seems to kinda rest in the grooves cutout for the wrist rest, if you lift the keyboard the wrist rest will fall off.ROG Armoury II, the software used to control ROG peripherals is really nice. Macros are universal across lighting profiles (I absolutely love this). The Flare has onboard storage, which I expect at this pricepoint, and is nice (no more mismatched RGB while booting up). This also means I don\'t have to install software and copy files over to a DVD or USB drive just to use the keyboard on my laptop, or another PC. The Flare also has built in profile switching buttons (thank you) and you don\'t have to unplug the keyboard to factory reset (also a nice touch, I think).There are probably better keyboards for less, but I prefer Asus products and I don\'t think it was money poorly spent. I\'m loving this keyboard and I highly recommend it for those who like MX Brown (or similar) switches and want a nice, high quality RGB mechanical keyboard.','2021-12-19 23:16:55',5,1,244),(630,'  Razer now has competition.Let me say prior to anything else that I keep my devices clean and don\'t smoke or spill liquids or have any other habits that could cause damage. I clean my keyboards roughly once every three or four weeks and do my best to keep them in good shape.That said, I\'ve previously owned four razer blackwidow keyboards, so I know darn well what a bad keyboard is like, and I must say I\'m VERY impressed by ASUS with this one.I have purchased two of this specific ROG Strix keyboard with the brown switches in the last five months, each lasting about two before keys will stop registering or responding (which is dangerously similar to razer\'s products). Prior to these critical malfunctions, it\'s not rare that I need to restart the armory software or unplug the keyboard and put it back in to get the lights going. I have yet to see armory crash, though, so that already makes it better than razer. However, with approximately the same span of time before things start to act up, it\'s not a lengthy superiority. As a matter of fact, even despite poor functionality and lifespan, this board has fewer customization options than razer. FAR fewer. To make it worse, macro usage in the armory doesn\'t register as macros in any programs. It comes through as a simple one-key input, no matter how you mess with the options.At that, the only thing that makes this board worth any more than what you could get from razer is mere preference of company. Personally, I favor ASUS because there\'s less support for blizzard and their logo is respectable, along with the fact that ASUS does make other peripherals that work phenomenally well (not to mention their even more superior components). Sorry, razer. Only one other competitor in this race, and you still lose.Given that I\'ve used a Corsair keyboard for six months with ONE software-restarting issue to occur more than two months into its time of use (which, again, is the approximate lifespan of this board) before selling it to make money for one of these, the brand of choice is quite clear.I love you, ASUS, but garbage is garbage. This is garbage.','2021-12-19 23:16:56',1,12,244),(631,'  I\'m just going to shoot this straight: I don\'t think I can ever go back now. I bought the ROG STRIX Cherry MX Blue version of this keyboard, and it\'s a completely different beast compared to the terrible (my opinion) actuation of the MX Speed/Silver/Red switches. I get full actuation, and I love the overall layout. The USB pass-through, along with volume control, were two big selling points, but the MX Blues make this keyboard my favorite, hands down. The RGB lighting is bright enough that I can see in pitch black, and the overall quality of the board makes it feel sturdy, with added life & longevity.I very much enjoyed the stock key caps on mine, but I really wanted to give PBT keys a try. If you do decide to grab this board, and you should, I would suggest upgraded to some sort of PBT key cap, specifically pudding key caps. You won\'t regret the added bonus of quality + durability.10/10! Never owned a ROG STRIX product before this, but I\'m sold on quality if this is where it leads!','2021-12-19 23:16:57',5,5,244),(632,'  This keyboard has more weight than I thought, this is my first mechanical keyboard. It\'s different, the keys are very sensitive and loud, but it\'s a mechanical keyboard of course it\'s loud. It takes a while to get used to, I\'m so used to using this keyboard, now my laptops keyboard feels like garbage compared to this, it\'s so stiff. The RGB lights are nice, it matches my computer, I use Asus aura sync most of the time it\'s blue, not RGB. Overall it\'s well built, it feels nice, it needs an update through ROG armory before use. Don\'t buy it you are using corsair lights in your PC, corsair uses didn\'t software (just an FYI for anyone who wants to have RGB lights that sync together). I used all Asus aura compatible products and I like it.','2021-12-19 23:16:58',5,14,244),(633,'  I\'m picky about my keyboards, and it took a long time to find one that I like.I\'ve owned this keyboard for a little while now (first phase of my new computer set up). In the time that I\'ve had it, I only have one major complaint about it, and it\'s not even the keyboard itself. It\'s the software. Asus Armory is a little finicky and a lot of the times bugs out, but I\'m not letting that sway my opinion on the keyboard since it has presets that work just fine (so you can avoid the more convoluted software and color customization if you don\'t feel like fighting with it) .I\'ll start with the overall quality of the keyboard. It\'s sturdy, doesn\'t flex at all (unless you want to practice your chest compressions on it). The fact the the border keys are the lighter pink while the inside is a grey color is very nice for the main reason of cleanliness. The pink gets filthy, even with regular cleaning and wiping down. It\'s a light color, so what else is there to expect? The Matching mouse mat also gets rather dirty, but weekly washing makes that better.The extent of customization for the back lighting is amazing. I tend to have fun with the custom colors and I even have specific WASD profiles for different games. The bar for volume (or would it be a dial?) is lovely for small adjustments. I wish there was a separate mute button instead of pressing on the dial, but that\'s just a small personal issue.The wrap this up, because this was my first purchase towards my entire new set up [roughly a $3.2k computer], I am beyond ecstatic to say I\'ve been purchasing more Asus products. The quality is great, customer service fantastic, and I can customize and personalize to my heart\'s content. Thank you, Asus <3','2021-12-19 23:16:59',5,8,244),(634,'  I only just received my delivery and set it up, so I will adjust thi review accordingly if the need arises. I can say without a doubt this keyboard feels the best out of all of them that I have used in the past. I decided to give the recent release Roccat Vulcan a try and started having double type issues within a month, so I decide to switch to this, and it is beyond comparison how much better this one feels. The Roccat wasn\'t bad that typing issue aside, but to say I preferred that over this would be a lie. This keyboard does feel like it is a little bit high and I am hoping it doesn\'t cause tiredness in my wrist, but we\'ll see. Again, take this with a grain of salt since I haven\'t actually used it much yet, but initial use is great.','2020-09-10 03:00:00',5,1,244),(635,'  This keyboard is great. At first we were hesitant to buy it because it was so expensive and we didn\'t understand why. Other than the aura sync feature, it didn\'t make sense to be that much. We understood once we opened the box and plugged it in. Not only is it a very solid keyboard, made out of good materials... It syncs with Aura, meaning all of our lights are matching each other. This keyboard looks great, feels great, and has a bunch of customizable options available. It comes with some spare parts, I don\'t know what they\'re called to let you know what spare parts they come with, but just know that there are some.The downfall to this keyboard is that it is massive in size. At least compared to our cheap keyboard that we had before, that was not a gamer keyboard. If you\'re building your first gamer PC, keep in mind that the keyboard is going to be a lot bigger, therefore requiring a bigger desk. We bought a desk from Amazon a few weeks prior to buying this keyboard, only to find out that it didn\'t fit on the computer desk. pretty crappy when you\'ve already assembled the desk and you can\'t return it anymore, right? Either way, we made it work but I wish we would have put that into consideration before buying the desk because I would have picked something else. You have the option to remove the additional palm holder. Again, I don\'t know the terminology... But the piece at the bottom of the keyboard where you rest your palm, that piece can be removed. Although, I don\'t recommend it because it is very comfortable.Bottom line is, this is a solid keyboard and in my opinion it is worth the money it\'s being sold for. If you want the best, go with this one.','2021-07-30 04:00:00',5,18,244),(636,'  So, this keyboard I\'ve had for over a year now, and I absolutely love it. Click and clack\'s have stayed true and they keys have gotten a bit worn out, but nothing that a bit of cleaning won\'t fix. RGB software is absolutely bad, if you use their old ASUS Aura and ROG armory applications, they actually do wonders for the keyboard. Though use the new Armory II software to update the keyboards software (really important).THE FATAL FLAW: If you are booting your PC up, and Windows or Linux has not popped up yet, DO NOT CLICK THE BRIGHTNESS HOTKEY ON THE TOP OF THE KEYBOARD NXET TO THE WINDOWS LOCK BUTTON. It will brick your keyboard. If you ask Asus to help fix it, they will ask for a 30-35 dollar charge into looking into it. This is not stated anywhere, but KEEP IT IN MIND. Don\'t click on boot up. Asus support said to update the keyboards firmware as it \"addresses\" the problem, but I could not get them to say that it \"fixes\" the problem. Which means that the bug is probably still there. EVGA came out with a new keyboard recently and for my next one,  I may be looking towards there. That bug is just so bad. And it exists in all of the models except for the COD one I believe, in which they had patched it there. I got lucky and Amazon support helped me out and get it replaced, but don\'t bet on it. If you\'re okay with that problem, it\'s a damn good keyboard otherwise! Just sucks when you aren\'t warned about such a terrible problem.','2021-12-19 23:16:54',3,17,244),(637,'            Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n        \n\n\n   I\'m absolutely in love with this keyboard. A little pricy but I was willing to pay more because it had everything I wanted. The color and LEDs are beautiful. I love that you can customize the logo although I have yet to actually do it. Haven\'t found time. I also love that this keyboard has a numpad and media keys. The scroll wheel is smooth and not clicky. The keyboard itself is everything I wanted and I adore it.However, I must note that the gray keys are much darker in person than they are pictured. Not a huge deal to me in the slightest and can always get new keycaps. Just wanted to note in case it\'s a bother for anyone else.The software is rather annoying. I spent forever even trying to find it online. Half the time it shuts down as soon as I try to open the app. However, when it does work, you can use presets and also create your own. These are set up on different profiles and as long as you have what you what set on a profile, you can switch between them without having to open the software which is helpful.One last thing is that the hand rest is hard and not soft. I\'ve had the keyboard for months and it has never bothered me although it may not be everyone\'s cup of tea. However, it is detachable! You don\'t need to use it.All of this being said, none of these bother me which is why I give 5 stars. Only stating for others\' benefits. I\'m in love with this keyboard and couldn\'t imagine having any other.','2019-11-18 14:15:00',5,18,244),(638,'  I was very excited to receive this keybaord. I\'ve always wanted a white keyboard, but they\'re quite uncommon, especially in a TKL size. Sadly, the Apex 7 Ghost was rather disappointing.They keyboard itself looks and feels nice. Fit and finish is excelent, and it feels solid, if a little light weight. The switches feel excellent, nice and smooth, very little friction, and very linear force. The little cable guides on the bottom are also quite helpful.Sadly, that\'s all the good things I have to say. The cable is horrible, it is very thick and stiff, is NOT braided, and is this weird gray color that will match nothing in your setup. It looks like it came from a cheap MP3 player from the late 90s.The legend on the keycaps is quite ugly, it just looks like the defualt font on whatever program they used to design the keyboard. It makes it look like a cheap knockoff from china.The wrist rest feels nice, but I doubt the soft touch plastic will hold up for more than a few years before it gets all sticky and nasty. It\'s also a disgusting off-white color, it looks like it has endured 5+ years of greasy sweaty palms rubbing against it, it looks like it\'s really old and faded.The OLED screen is nice, but to use it you need to use little apps on the SteelSeries engine, which are very clunky and feel hacked together. It\'s also pathetically dim, even under artificial lighting it looks like it\'s in a power saving mode or something (which it isn\'t).The little wheel is used to adjust the volume, and you can click it to mute your PC. Sadly, the metal surface has very little friction, so to get it to turn you need to press down on it quite a bit, which causes it to click. This makes adjusting the volume nearly impossible because you just end up muting your PC.Sadly, I\'ll be returning this keyboard. It looks awesome and I like the size, but it\'s just a mediocre keyboard when compared to the competition. My 5 year old Corsair K65 is much better in almost every respect.','2021-12-05 15:29:15',5,16,245),(639,'            Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n        \n\n\n   Been looking for a new keyboard for a while now but finding a white keyboard that looks cool and is actually decent is a little challenging. Then SteelSeries came out with this limited edition keyboard and I knew this was the one. It looks so nice and clean in person, the key caps are lovely, the red switches are a nice change coming from loud and clicky blues, the build quality is solid and it feels sturdy, and I like the extra features like the USB pass-thru and the media controls. The small OLED screen is cool too but I haven\'t really done much in the way of customizing it yet. I mean really, you shouldn\'t be looking at your keyboard for in game alerts and such.All in all if you\'re looking for a nice clean looking and well built white/silver keyboard, this one should definitely be on your list.Oh and it\'s worth noting that because of the OLED screen, the Print Screen, Scroll Lock, and Pause/Break buttons aren\'t there. Not really a huge deal if you don\'t use those that often, but it\'s still worth mentioning.','2017-08-09 09:00:00',3,12,246),(640,'  The best rgb ever! With limited white color .Comfortable and fast','2021-03-14 17:00:00',4,4,246),(641,'  Sorry for only one picture. I had taken many photos of both keyboards but Amazon is not allowing me to upload images from my gallery so just took this shot to show both keyboards together.Despite buying primarily Razer products I am NOT a Razer Fan boy and my reviews are completely honest.I have been using both keyboards for more than a month now and ended up settling on the black widow.I bought both keyboards with Amazon Renew which gives you a 90 day return policy so it\'s a great way to get to know a product before keeping it and save some money too! The Huntsman is a nice keyboard but ultimately the black widow 65% form factor is was the determining factor the fact it could also share the dongle of my mouse was a nice bonus.  I will go into details below of the pros and cons of both.First I want to say, if you are not already in the Razer eco system like I am you may want to explore other options because the Razer Synapse is probably the only problem with these keyboards. Maybe Razer will fix them with updates, but I doubt it because they have a good enough approach to certain things.Black Widow (BW) 65% vs Huntsman (HM) 60%- Switches: The BW yellow switches only make sounds when released while the HM red switches make a sound when they bottom out and when released making this the louder of the two. They both feel like quality switches but the HM keys feel more stable. Also if you don\'t know the HM switches are optical and will last longer and have a faster response time but I find them to be way to sensitive to type on. The BW ditches allow the LED light to shine through which means if you switch key caps you won\'t be disappointed with the results. That said the HM had me feeling not impressed with some new key caps I purchased for the fact the the light only shines away from you. This is exaggerated by the spacebar. The BW is definitely the brighter option which is shocking since it is wireless.- 65% or 60%: I don\'t know why anyone would have a 60% keyboard if a 65% is an option. Removing arrow keys from a keyboard means you have to use your mouse when typing. I am a programmer and this quickly became a hindrance in my productivity. Razer gives access to the arrow keys by means of pressing function but the location is unnatural and you will quickly opt to using the mouse instead. This brings up one of the issues with Razer Synapse and that is you can\'t map Razers preset \"hyper shift\" keys so you can\'t correct the placement of things. Using the 60% as a dedicated gaming keyboards means you will be limited on custom mapping most of the keyboard.- Design: I think the HM has a much cleaner design with the small bezels. I honestly wish the HM was 65% and this would be a really hard choice. They both feel like quality keyboards but the HM comes with PBT Keycaps which makes this feel like the more premium choice even though the BW is twice the price.- Connectivity: The BW wins hands down offering Bluetooth, 2.4ghz and usb-c and unlike the HM the usb-c connector is not proprietary. I put a magnetic connector on the BW so that I can quickly connect it for charging only and leave it on 2.4ghz. works great but only issue with the BW is the keyboard goes to sleep even when charging and it doesn\'t wake quick enough to not be annoying. Can\'t seem to disable the feature either even if you have it off in the settings. Since I game with the Tartarus if I switch to the keyboard to quickly type something it is usually a sleep and the delay can be costly while gaming. Also Bluetooth seems to not be the best, I had to repair multiple times when I trying to reconnect to my computer using it. I try to just stick with the 2.4ghz. You have to connect all razer products to the USB ports directly on your computer or you will experience buggy behavior. The fact that the BW can use the same dongle as the Naga mouse means I only need 2 USB ports for my current setup and can avoid the bugs that razer doesn\'t want to address. One of those bugs is an increased frequency of key press lockups which I will go into more detail later.- Function: I found with both the BW and the HM and even the Tartarus Pro that sometines keys get stuck in a active/pressed state. This seems to be software related but I thought I would mention it. To fix it you have to press that same key again and rarely but sometimes you have to disconnect the device. Seems to be a trend with Razer products if you do your research. The sensitivity of the HM makes it a little more difficult to type on the the BW. Even just slightly resting your finger on a key will trigger it, seriously.What I would like to see:- Razer Synapse not restricting a users ability to customize the keyboard. That is the point of these gaming keyboards, isn\'t it.- fix the issue with the stuck keys, I don\'t see how any competitive gamer would trust a razer keyboard.Warning:In regards to all razer products, they don\'t work well when connected to any hub and must be connected directly to the computer. This includes Razers own hubs SMH! I have a Razer Core V2 and don\'t use the USB ports on it for my keyboard or mouse like I thought I could do. I think this is an issue with their Razer Synapse software because before I went all in on Razer I was all in on Logitech and never had issues with using USB hubs/docking stations. Razer is aware of the problem and instead of fixing it just tells users to connect directly to the computer/laptop.  So if you go razer, make sure you have enough USB ports. That said connecting directly to your computer doesn\'t remove the issues their hardware has, just makes them less frequent and more tolerable, maybe, if you don\'t mind losing because of a stuck key once or twice every couple of days.Update 8/17/2021:Razer has since released some updates to their synapse software. I wish I could say that I noticed improvements but instead I am experiencing a higher frequency of stuck keys. I am seriously beginning to regret my purchase.Update 11/29/2021:I regret this purchase... Only buy if you enjoy a keyboard that goes to sleep even when hardwired and takes like 5 seconds to wake up. This means copy and paste will sometimes fail on the copy because keyboard was sleeping or you think you are typing but you are not lol. So if you throw in the fact that you will get random stuck keys and sometimes profile changes what you actually have is just an annoying keyboard. I have never done so many updates on a review, this is what a mistake it is to purchase this hardware. And take it from me, someone who has a lot of razer products and all of which have similar issues... look else where, Razer is not the company you remember, very disappointing.','2021-01-05 23:30:00',1,11,246),(642,'  Pros:- Good linear switches (Razer Yellows)- Decent stabilizers when you apply some lube- Fantastic 65% form factor- Doesn\'t require synapse at all times- Lighting is nice and bright- Wireless capabilities (if you need a wireless keyboard for some reason)Cons:- Price is a bit high (I\'d wait for the price to come down)Thoughts:This is a really good keyboard in pretty much every way, especially coming from a big named gaming company. The dampened linear yellows feel and sound pretty good, stabs sound and feel smooth with a little added dielectric grease, all the features and functionalities you can expect for a \"gaming\" keyboard, and the 65% form factor is, in my opinion, the perfect compact size since you get to keep arrow keys and others like delete, etc... My only gripe with this keyboard is the price. $180 for a compact keyboard is about $70 or $80 too high. All that extra cost comes from the wireless functionality, which I have absolutely no use for. Wireless mice? All day. I don\'t like feeling any cable slapping around while I\'m moving my mouse, but my keyboard sits in one spot on my desk. If it\'s moving, there\'s a problem. I guess I could see wanting a wireless keyboard if you\'re going for a clean, no wires setup, or if you\'re playing from your couch, but they\'re kinda shooting themselves in the foot not offering a wired version for less money. That\'s really the only thing docking a star for me. Otherwise, this is a really good board, and in my opinion would make things like Ducky irrelevant, if it were priced right. So in conclusion, if you\'re wanting this keyboard and are on the fence, maybe wait for it to come down in price, or for a sale.','2021-12-19 23:16:49',1,11,246),(643,'  The size and quality of this keyboard was great, and I loved the feeling of the yellow switch keys...but well, that\'s pretty much it. I had issues with the keyboard being detected by Razer synapse, and the volume keys (fn+b or n or m) does not work, among other things. Oh, and the Hyperspeed multi-device connection does not work. I followed all the debugging/troubleshooting steps from the Razer website and even used their utility. I updated all firmware and Razer synapse. I uninstalled/reinstalled Razer synapse multiple times, tried on different ports, etc, but nothing worked. Finally, I reached out to Razer customer service...but wow.I\'m just completely disappointed with Razer. For a company that is supposed to be for gamers with products at the higher end of the price range, you would think their technical support and customer service would also be good...but it\'s horrible. I\'ve never encountered such a horrible customer service before.I provided information on the product and the troubleshooting steps I took, but they don\'t read or understand your problem and instead just respond with a barrage of superfluous cookie-cutter questions (27, I counted) that were already answered or unneeded to solve the problem. Then after you reply to everything, they ask you to send a copy of the receipt...which I don\'t understand why you need when you\'ve already given them the order number and order date? And I\'m not sure how that is supposed to help with troubleshooting when the serial number, product# etc were all already provided as well? It feels as if they are just trying to stall until the product is no longer in the return period. But that\'s not even the worst part. After all that (around 2 weeks of emails back and forth) it turns out they didn\'t even understand or read what my problem was. Then they just told me that since it was still within the return period, I should just return it to Amazon. What the hell? So there\'s no solution? Their products are a piece of crap that won\'t work and that\'s it? There\'s no solution? The solution is to just not use Razer products?This is absolutely hilarious.','2021-12-19 23:16:50',5,3,246),(644,'  - Intermittent lost of connectivity issue (connect with the 2.4ghz \"hyperspeed\" dongle)- Synapse constantly wrongly detect the battery status as 0% ​(the keyboard is fully charged)- Weird behavior after idle for 1 min, while watching movies/shows in fullscreen mode, the keyboard will straight disconnect from my pc, and takes very long time to reconnect back (does not seems like a normal standby/idle mode)- All the above issues gets even worse when the keyboard battery is dropped below 10% for real. Connection dropout every few seconds, keystroke wont register, RGB lightning effect will stopped abruptly.Had enough with Razer products, they charge a premium price ($179 for a 65% keyboard???) for a half baked, non functional, mediocre product with an extremely bugged software (Synapse), this will be the first and also the last time i ever get a wireless keyboard from Razer.

With this, both work, although I had to update the naga pro firmware to do that. I bought this eailer this year at full price I think, not sure, but it was worth the higher price. I got the yellow switch for improvements of noise. and it is much quiter then the blackwidow yellow elite v3 which is louder then green switch depending on how much force you apply. The multi dongle support is very good, but unlike logitech, only supports 1 mouse and 1 keyboard. unlike logitech, this is high performence wireless while logitech unfying is low end. Downside is lower battery life compared to bluetooth.As well, an interesting feature is my deathadder v2 pro naga pro and blackwidow v3 mini hyperspeed yellow all work on bluetooth 4.0 depsite razer advertsing 5.0 instead.','2021-12-19 23:16:52',3,19,246),(646,'  I was actually looking forward to this keyboard to replace my G915 TKL. I got it the day after it was released and was excited to use it. While playing COD, I noticed that the W key suddenly stops working mid-game. I have to re-press it reengage. I thought it was just a glitch in the game. However, I tried opening notepad and hold the W key. To my surprise, I see that it randomly stops working. See the  photo of my test. I did this several times and got the same inconsistent result.  This could just be a defective unit. Other keys do not have the same problem.','2021-12-19 23:16:53',2,11,246),(647,'  It’s just not worth the price even the discount I got on it wasn’t worth it so I sent it back.

Skip this one.','2021-12-19 23:16:54',4,6,246),(648,'  For the price of this keyboard, I would give it a 2 stars. I have an Anne Pro 2 that is comparable to this with the only exception of 2.4 ghz connection, which is why I had sought out this keyboard.For less than 80 USD my other keyboard came with PBT caps rather than the cheaper ABS key caps that comes with this keyboard. Keys wise, there is a lot of wiggle, like way too much give in how much they can wiggle around before you even click the keys.The more I use this keyboard the more I really think that I overpaid for this 150+ keyboard that is, at the end of the day, basically my previous keyboard.I would suggest for people to try out the full sized keyboard, as this 60% form factor really does not work well in my opinion.','2021-12-19 23:16:55',5,20,246),(649,'  I actually only have issues with this board that are almost entirely due to personal preference. I would have loved this board if not for the fact that, due to the small form factor, razer had to place the missing keys functions as secondary functions into the remaining keys. While this alone isn\'t a broad issue, the problem is that the Hypershift function is not independent of these functions put into the keys, and therefore those keys cannot be remapped for when Hypershift is active. Sadly this affected 4 keys I frequently use for gaming and remapping, that being the C, V, B and G keys, so this board simply did not work out for me. Ended up returning it, but if this does not affect you as a gamer and want a good wireless 65% board, I strongly recommend it. Just be sure this design choice doesnt interfere with your playstyle.','2021-12-19 23:16:56',3,9,247),(650,'  Good balance between size and functionality. Better than the 60% since it has the arrow keys. Only downside is the price, it is too expensive for such a basic keyboard. I wish Razer added more features like dedicated media buttons or volume rocker to justify its price.Overall: it is a good product but you can buy other 65% keyboards out there with cheaper price and added functionality (e.g. Asus falchion).','2021-12-19 23:16:57',1,18,247),(651,'  Corsair kind of makes me sick with this keyboard.  I expect a lot more from a company like Corsair and I have owned many of their products.  BEWARE before buying this.  I took this brand new keyboard out of the box and plugged it in.  I must say it looks beautiful and feels great under my fingers.  I went through a lot of trouble to connect this to my keyboard.  The cord is very think and has two USB ports that must be plugged in.  My computer is 6 feet high and the cable routing is a challenge so I only like to do things once.  I got it all setup properly and downloaded the new Corsair software.  While setting it up the first thing I see is an \"update software\" button.  I always like to have the newest and best drivers and software running so of course I click that.  Suddenly, the key board DIED.  dead out no lights no response.  I bricked the keyboard, from their software update.  I go through quite on order, unplugging and plugging it back in, rebooting my computer, the whole 9 yards.  So now I have to undo everything I did and plug the old keyboard back in to get on the internet to see what I did.  Something I wanted to avoid as I said my computer is high and not easily accessible.  After some time of searching I find out, this is a KNOWN issue for this keyboard and Corsair refuses to acknowledge or correct it.  Shame shame on you!  why would you put your customers through this?  and how many RGA\'s do you have to go through from people who arent skilled enough to search this, download the correct bin file, replace it on the keyboard memory and REBOOT the keyboard?  which is another thing, the reboot process is just insane to have us hold in a tiny button in with a pin while trying to plug and unplug TWO USB cables.  even if most computers arent 6 feet in the air.  This is a known issue, many many people on the forums have had the same problems,  your software is bricking YOUR own $200 keyboard.  fix the problem corsair and stop telling people its not your fault.  Liars make me sick, lying companies are worse.  anyone with google can verify this situation and you deny it and refuse to fix it.  I would expect this from a $30 Chinese knock off, not you.  Your software is crappy and overly complicated.  Many times I have had my lighting freeze and programming the G keys is just overly cumbersome.  I  am so disappointed that a wonderful and well built keyboard from a top notch company is ruined by the software experience.  Please get your game together.  Until then I would recommend people consider these issues and possibly avoid this keyboard.','2021-12-19 23:16:58',5,16,247),(652,'  A mechanical keyboard with per-key RGB, dedicated media controls, dedicated macro keys, double-shot keycaps, 10-key, no ridiculously over-the-top \"gamer\" styling, and MX blues. This is my unicorn. I can\'t adequately express my disappointment.My first purchase has a USB passthrough that only intermittently works. On top of that, there is a very loud metallic ping. It\'s not a problem with the switches, nor the keycaps like Corsair\'s support suggests. I sent for a replacement. The volume wheel on the replacement sticks and the pinging is even worse. I was even okay with the LEDs being dimmer than my current K95, but these problems are unacceptable at this price point.This is not the first time I\'ve run into quality control failures with Corsair keyboards. When the RGB Strafe first became available with MX blues I jumped on it. I went through 3 or 4 boards, all with multiple keys that were completely unusable. Mushy spacebar that would not spring back up, other keys with the same behavior. I ended up simply going with MX browns instead and finally got a board that worked properly. Even my current K95 Platinum with MX browns, I\'m not 100% happy with. The volume wheel has been off since day one. Rolls to a point and then \'pop\' like it gets stuck on something. I baby my electronics so it\'s not like I broke it over time. At least the keys all work and there is no pinging when I type.I think I\'m just done with Corsair peripherals. When the time comes that I need to replace this board, I will just go with something else. Maybe a Razer. At a $200 price point for a keyboard, I expect perfection which this product does NOT deliver. Funny thing is, I would pay even more for that perfection if someone built it.','2021-12-19 23:16:59',4,3,247),(653,'  I owned the Corsair K95 RGB Platinum (non XT model) for two years before taking ownership of this newer model and it continues the same excellent features:Cherry MX Speed Silver switches (100 million keypresses)Per key RGB settingsPBT Double Shot KeycapsFull Media controlsUSB 3.0 passthroughHIgh grade aluminum frameInfinitely customizable through iCUE softwarePlenty of other reviewers will write more but I did test this keyboard against my old K95 RGB Plat and against the Steelseries Arctis Pro and Razer Huntsman Elite (optical). I ended up liking this Corsair K95 XT just a tad more than the Arctis Pro. The only thing I do not like about this board is the need to install the huge bloatware iCUE to get full control over the lighting and firmware upgrades. This is the Rolls Royce of gaming keyboards for 2020. 4.7 stars out of 5.','2020-09-10 03:00:00',3,6,247),(654,'  One online review I read called the Corsair K95 RGB Platinum keyboard the “Rolls Royce of gaming keyboards.”  As an all-around keyboard, however, it\'s not only a Rolls Royce but also a Ferrari, Aston Martin, Maserati, Bently...well, you get the picture.  The K95 XT also falls under this description.  One of the first things you’ll notice about either K95, are their heft and stiffness.  This thing weighs a ton (for a keyboard).  Both of the K95s owe their heft and rigidity to their inspired aircraft-grade anodized brushed aluminum frame, which screams: QUALITY!  As a result, the K95 doesn’t flex even under the most relentless pounding as most plastic keyboards would.  The next thing that pops out at you is this keyboard’s beauty.  Corsair has long been known for its quality keyboards and the K95 XT doesn’t disappoint in the least.  Compared to all other keyboards (regardless of price), both K95s are works of art you’ll continue to appreciate long after you’ve purchased one.I purchased a K95 in 2019 and a K95 XT in 2020.  These two keyboards are nearly identical, so one may ask, “Why would you buy two nearly identical and VERY expensive keyboards?”  Of course, I could answer, “Because I can,” but the very subtle improvements of the K95 XT simply won me over.  Little things bothered me.  I ordered my K95 with Brown switches because that was the closest choice to my preferred keyswitch, the Blues, which were unavailable on the original K95.  Corsair, in my opinion, made a huge mistake not offering Blue and Green keyswitches with the original K95.  They could have sold many more K95s had they done so.  I ordered my K95 XT with Blue switches.  In addition, I hated the cheap, hard plastic wrist rest that came with the original K95.  The K95 XT’s pillow-like plush leatherette wrist rest is a HUGE improvement and brings its flagship keyboard up to the standard long ago adopted by many of the best keyboard manufacturers, all Corsair competitors.There are, of course, other subtleties that won me over to the K95 XT, but the elephant in the room was the real reason for my purchase of an XT—my K95 had a glaring malfunction: the USB disconnected continually, rendering the keyboard useless. Corsair gladly suggested I return the keyboard in exchange for a new one.  I never did return the K95 because I was convinced the problem was with the iCUE software, not the keyboard.  I decided to wait until Corsair fixed the software problem.  I was wrong, it WAS a hardware problem.  Now it’s too late to return the keyboard.  My new K95 XT, thankfully, is free of this hardware problem (experienced by MANY K95 purchasers), and works flawlessly.  I regret not sending my original K95 back to Corsair in exchange for a new one.  It does, however, serve as a very excellent paperweight.My purchase of an XT and not another high-end keyboard like Corsair’s new K100, reveals my fondness for the original K95 design: solid, beautiful, classic, refined, stylish, but not flashy.  It is still a work of art, professional and preferable to DIY mechanical keyboards.  Many “in-the-know” folks say that an owner of the original K95 should stay the course rather than “upgrade” to the XT and, in large part, I agree.  Unless, of course, you’re like me and can use and appreciate the subtle improvements of the XT and can afford the expense.Mechanical KeyswitchesAs a flagship keyboard, the K95 XT is, of course, a mechanical keyboard, which refers to its mechanical keyswitches.  The keyswitch choice for the K95 is, unfortunately, very limited to two types: Cherry MX Speed and Cherry MX Brown.  The K95 XT adds Cherry MX Blue and Cherry MX Speed Silvers.  Of course, the Speeds are preferable for gaming while the Browns are meant to be a compromise between gaming and typing.  The Blues are clickier versions of the Browns, a very popular keyswitch and my personal favorite, although I fell in love with the Browns.  While I infrequently play video games and most of my work involves writing and general typing, the Speeds were out of the question for me.  I can’t get enough (obviously) of the loud click and tactile bump the Blues and Greens provide.  Many would agree with me, but just as many find the Blues and Greens to be intolerable (as do other members of the household and fellow office workers often do).  The Browns are really a “silent” version of the Blues and don’t provide much of a tactile bump.  Still, the Browns manage to deliver a VERY satisfying typing experience.  They are crisp, precise and not all that silent.By-the-way, when referencing a Cherry MX Blue keyswitch, know that Cherry is the name of the manufacturer, a German company.  MX stands for “mechanical” and Blue describes this keyswitch’s “clickyness” and tactile bump.Macro Keys and RemappingPerhaps the most useful feature of the K95s are the six macro keys running down the left side of the keyboard.  Along with the iCUE software that is downloadable from the Corsair website, you can program these macro keys to use keyboard events, mouse movements, mouse clicks and the mouse wheel to issue complex commands, select menu items or type long strings of characters.  Macros in each profile can be activated by a specific program associated with them, or you can manually switch between each profile with a simple key press.  Although there are only six macro keys, up to three onboard profiles (five with the XT) allow you to program and use up to eighteen macros (thirty with the XT). Unfortunately, many find programming macros and profiles in iCUE to be quite difficult.  The iCUE software does not present an intuitive interface and commands.  For instance, there’s no way to “save” a macro or profile.  Unintuitively, iCUE saves the macro or profile you create automatically, without need to issue a “save” command.  Many find this “feature” disconcerting (was the macro saved or not?).  The complexity and confusion of the iCUE software is due to its ability to use keyboard events, mouse movements, mouse clicks and the mouse wheel to issue complex commands and select menu items, not just keyboard events.  Learning to create profiles, for some, has a long learning curve and viewing YouTube videos to learn how to create profiles is essential. The tutorial videos on the Corsair website are often narrated by speed-talkers who fly through explanations so fast, you find yourself rewinding sections and reviewing them over and over.  I must say, however, that once you “get the hang of it,” iCUE is a joy to use.Some people find the location of the macro keys problematic.  Some mistake the G1 key with the “ESC” key, while others mistake the G6 key with the “CTRL” key.  Fortunately, I have no such problem since the macro keys are textured and color-coded.  What if eighteen macro keys aren’t enough for you?  The iCUE software enables you to “remap” any key to do anything you want it to do, including making keys other than the six G keys behave like macro keys.  This allows you to use those otherwise almost useless “F” keys at the top of the keyboard to finally start pulling their own weight as additional macro keys.  Also, often unused keys (like the Pause / Break key, the Insert key, the Scroll Lock key, etc.) can be remapped to become macro keys.  This remapping capability is a delight, an efficiency booster and time saver.RGB BacklightingThe keys on the K95s are individually lit (also called, “per-key backlighting”), unlike some RGB keyboards which often use zone lighting.  In zone lighting, one cannot assign a color to just one key…it has to be to a third of the keys on the keyboard or a fourth.  In fact, most “RGB” keyboards utilize zone lighting, not per-key lighting, which is a premium feature.  The keycap characters on both K95s are big, bold and allow plenty of backlight to shine through them, making typing in low light or no light situations a breeze.  The XT has double-shot PBT keycaps which is somewhat of an improvement over the K95.  Many backlit keyboards use small, skinny keycap characters and/or dim backlighting, negating the whole point of backlit keys.  Such keyboards make typing in the dark a difficult proposition.  The K95s have a button with a sun symbol on it which adjusts backlight brightness: Off, Dim, Medium and Bright.The K95s use true RGB L.E.D. lighting.  Many keyboards tout RGB backlighting as a feature.  In their case, it’s true that Red+Blue=Purple and that other combinations of Red, Green and Blue (RGB) can create other colors.  Such keyboards, in reality, have only eight or ten colors available to them.  However, the K95s use the entire RGB spectrum, which contains approximately 16.8 million colors.  The K95s utilize “brightness” to expand the RGB spectrum.  This allows the K95 to display truly amazing lighting effects such as the “Spiral Rainbow” and other effects which you can either create yourself or import into iCUE from the internet or obtain from a friend.You can also customize the keyboard with functional backlighting.  For instance, I made all the alphabetic character keys shine with a white light, while the number pad keys illuminate in cyan; the ESC, Delete, Enter, Backspace, Del, keypad Num, Enter and Decimal point keys all shine in red; the Tab, Caps Lock and both Shift and Alt keys shine in blue, the G keys shine in pink, the F keys shine in cyan, etc.  The F key shines in yellow (YouTube enlarge, minimize window), while the J key shines in cyan (YouTube rewind 10 seconds), the K key shines in magenta (YouTube Stop) and the L key shines in green (YouTube advance 10 seconds).  This makes each grouping of keys distinct and quickly identifiable, making typing in a darkened environment much easier.  My computer desk happens to be located in a dimly-lit corner and I prefer working in a darkened environment anyway, but with the K95’s bold key characters and brilliant backlighting, typing is a cinch—especially at night, when that corner gets even darker.Whether you purchase the K95 (approximately $176) or the K95 XT (approximately $230), you’ll have a premium keyboard that’s a joy to use and a great addition to your art collection.  K95 users need not upgrade to the K95 XT unless they need and appreciate the K95 XT\'s subtle improvements and can afford the expense.  Both provide a keyboard’s basic functions and much more.  Except for some subtle differences, both K95s are basically indistinguishable from each other.','2021-07-30 04:00:00',5,6,247),(655,'  This keyboard has it all in terms of a feature list.Pros:1. Good switches. I went with MX Brown which is my preference for most mechanical keyboards.2. RGB is really good. Building layers to have a base backlight in addition to effects is really fun.3. The macro keys work well as long as you stick to the iCue software. Stream Deck is very limited.4. The volume scroll wheel is really nice. I wish all my keyboards had a scroll wheel like this.5. I can type fast (for me) with few mistakes.Neutral:1. I appreciate the Doubleshot PBT Keycaps but the keycaps on my Durgod feels much nicer.2. I actually like the wrist rest but I don\'t think it\'s quite as functional as it should be.Cons:1. Sound. Most mechanical switches produce a slight metallic resonance. This keyboard amplifies it the extent that you will hear it all the time. Honestly sometimes it\'s too much. Some will not mind if but if you don\'t want to hear high pitched metallic sounds with each keypress then don\'t buy this. Not a great sounding keyboard.2. No-standard bottom row key-caps. Not a huge deal but limits those who want to customize more.3. Bad software bricked mine. Three times!!! They claimed it was old software that failed to update the firmware but even after updating the software is bricked my keyboard. There\'s a manual work around posted on their forums.This is a keyboard where the sum is not greater than the parts. It has top parts and capability but overall it just doesn\'t hold up to some of the cheaper alternatives. I have a plain Durgod I got here on Amazon with no backlighting that I will always prefer over the Corsair because it types and sounds wonderful.But...if you don\'t care about sound or feel as much (why would you by a mechanical keyboard) and want all the bells and whistles then this might be your jam.One last note. I rate things harder than other people. 5 = the best I\'ve ever used. 4 = Excellent. I\'m giving this a 3 and it\'ll probably be a 4 or 5 for some of you.','2021-12-19 23:16:54',4,17,247),(656,'  starting my career on IBM mainframes way back in the day, I used 3277-type keyboards for years.  Loved the mechanical feel and that \"clack\" sound as you struck the keys.  After IBM sold their keyboard technology a couple of times, a company in Louisville bought the rights to produce the original design mechanical keyboards and I have been using them for years.  I started seeing Cherry MX keys popping up everywhere and looked into them to make sure I was not missing anything.  I ordered one of these and WOW.  I know some folks don\'t get excited about a keyboard, but I have worked from a home office for years and have several home PC\'s, so I use 3 keyboards across all of those systems.  I type a lot.  AND I have played FPS video games for about 25 years, so my keyboards get a workout.  This Corsair is simply fantastic.  I have always typed fast, but I can really fly across this board.  I got the brown Cherry keys that require almost a full stroke to actuate.  And corsair didn\'t forget about the FPS gamer in me.  they include replacement keys for W, A, S, D, the lifeblood of PC FPS gamers.  they have a dish shape and a diamond plate surface to prevent slippage.  I\'m not really into LED lighting systems on keyboards, so I have the light on all 3 keyboards set for white.  the soft padded wrist rest finishes out the package nicely.  This is an expensive keyboard, but if you are serious about your PC use, you must try one of these.  Cannot recommend highly enough..','2019-11-18 14:15:00',5,16,247),(657,'  I was worried after hearing that the Firmware might brick it. I made sure I had the latest iCUE installed. When I did the firmware it didn\'t do anything after install, so I reset my PC, and tried again. Second time it told me to plug in my keyboard, so I had to unplug, and plugged it back in. I tried the firmware again, and it worked no problems. My Motherboard is an ASUS Maximus X Code. The keyboard feels good. I like the textured keys, and I also like all the extra keys that come with it. I like the wrist rest it\'s better than the plastic one on my old Logitech G910. The lighting is really bright. I also had no problems getting into the Bios when my PC Starts. I only marked it down because I had to resort to YouTube to figure how to customize the lighting, and I figure out the Macros on my own. I\'m happy with my purchase.','2021-12-05 15:29:15',1,10,247),(658,'  I bought this to replace my original K95 that had the cherry red switches. The speed switches feel just like the reds, I can\'t tell any difference at all to be honest (Which is fine, because I wanted something just like my old reds anyway). I game as well as code and type a lot and I\'ve never felt like the switches were uncomfortable for any of that, depends on if you are used to something so linear or not.The leather wrist rest is nice and soft and I like it a lot more than the old plastic one. I also like the newer audio control buttons as well as the RGB lighting on the top being nicer than the original keyboard was. Not sure what other issues some of the other reviewers are having, but I haven\'t had any problems at all with the software for this keyboard, no glitches or issues it all works perfectly fine.My ONE complaint is that I\'m sad the newer K95 keyboards only have 6 of the G-Keys now instead of the like 15 the old ones used to have. Not sure why they downgraded that part of the keyboard, but its a small complaint.Overall great keyboard, the build quality feels sturdy, the speeds feel just like reds, would buy this again.','2017-08-09 09:00:00',2,12,247),(659,'  As somebody who uses a keyboard a lot, I decided to splurge on a 200 keyboard with the name recognition of Corsair.  I don\'t really expect much, but I like that cherrys are replaceable and I liked the metal frame and the MX Brown switches.Excited to get my new keyboard, plugged it in and realized the \"A\" key needs about 5 lbs of pressure before registering.  The A key affectively doesn\'t work unless you\'re standing on it.  In addition, of the things I noticed in the first 5 minutes was the volume spinner at the top right.  HORRIBLE.  Spins freely but horrible scraping sound occurs intermittently as you spin in.  Constant but intermittent.  Complete crap.I didn\'t try all the other keys nor test anything else.  2 major flaws, unrelated to each other tell me this is not just a problem with my one keyboard.  The flaws encountered after the first 2 minutes using the thing were already deal-breakers.  I hate to think what I\'d find after some use.For $200?!?  Seriously Corsair.  I\'m not sure why Corsair decides to save a few bucks on quality control when their entire brand will forever be avoided now by people like me.  I have to box this back up, ship it back, drive the Amazon drop-off.  PAIN IN THE BUTT.Edit: Just bought a Durgod for $139.  The quality far surpasses this and I\'ll never go back to Corsair after this cutting-corners crap.  I hope their brand goes to crap.','2021-03-14 17:00:00',4,10,248),(660,'  *Update.  While this is a very premium feel keyboard its software package: ICue is not only causing crashes with my PC (because of conflicts with Logitech GHub) its user-friendliness is a joke.  Logitech\'s Ghub is vastly superior because Logitech develops game overlays in house for their product.  Trying to find custom overlays for major games for the Corsair K95 is futile and learning how to create your own is complicated.  GHub is much easier to use.This system error has been occurring now since I bought this product.

I go this primarily for its backlit keys.  I don\'t really understand why gamers needs such a pretty keyboard.  I think maybe some keys have special purposes for gaming and so are similarly colored.  On my keyboard for e.g. keys ASDW, up, down, left, right are colored differently from all the other keys - purple.  The number keys on the number pad are yellow, the operators red, the number keys on the main keyboard are red, the other letters turquoise(? one of those light blues) and the function keys are a bright blue, the home, ins, pg up etc. are green.  There are various effects for the lighting which I really dont get the purpose of.I like that there is an indicator for caps lock, and num lock and also a windows lock key.  Not sure what it does.There is a lot of play when pressing the keys.  You don\'t have to press hard but here is also space between the keys so it feels like you will press more than one key at a time but its surprisingly accurate.  The body feels good.  It sits a little high off the table surface as compared to my logitech wireless keyboard.  So I\'m not happy about that.  It forces my wrists up - I like my keyboard as flat as possible.Its not particularly noisy either.  I was expecting a loud clickety-clack-clack but not really.  My other option was to get one of those membrane keyboards and I am not a fan of them.  Dont like the feel.Thankfully the lights turn of when your PC sleeps.  Otherwise I imagine this could light up a dark room.Docking a star because I cant find a mode where all the keys are lit up the same color.  Why not man?  All these weird strobing and running and flashing effects but no ability to have just one solid color.  That feature for me would have made this a 5* keyboard.','2021-12-19 23:16:49',3,1,248),(662,'  I ended up giving it to my wife for 3 reasons.1) If it has a Lock for the Windows Key, I couldn\'t figure out the combination of buttons to push to activate it.2) Has multiple color settings but you can\'t pick specific colors.

The LEDs are really nice and work well. They have a lot of different settings and the brightness is adjustable. That part is great. The keys are the problem. The problem is that the design of the keys is like a square as opposed to a standard beveled key. This throws your tactile sense off and you can easily hit several keys when typing fast. That makes it VERY difficult to type quickly. I work and play games on my PC and I was making a ton of mistakes using this keyboard. Using the WASD was not possible and I just had to order a different one. I will give this one to my 6 YO son who loves the LEDs. It\'s possible you can buy a different set of keys for this thing.

I don\'t get the hype still and this wasn\'t the product to change my mind. It\'s an OK product but not really my thing.Some good things about this keyboard:- Feels like the quality is good, I believe it will last a long time. However it\'s hard to say because it\'s the first day having it.- I like the key shape, the rounded corners are nice and the keys are slightly concave from all 4 sides, but not too heavily. I tend to prefer flat keys, but these are pretty comfy.- It does have a cool aesthetic appearance. Kind of like those Retro Diners that have chrome trim everywhere.Some things I don\'t like:- As with all mechanical keyboards, the keys are huge in the vertical axis. I prefer doing everything with a chiclet keyboard and I will be going back to a chiclet keyboard soon, just going to leave this as a backup.- Even though these are not clicky switches, they\'re still pretty loud. You can hear the springs as you type and each keycap has quite a bit of \"wiggle\" so the keycaps themselves make a lot of noise when your fingers strike them.- To me, typing feels a bit awkward because the keys have a lot of travel, but the activation point is close to the top of the travel. I\'d say the activation point is somewhere around 2 mm, while I believe the keys bottom out at what feels like well over 5 mm. I don\'t have any way to measure it but to me this is an awkward combination for typing. Also makes it quite easy to accidentally press the wrong key while typing.- The color of the lighting is set for each key, you can\'t change it. There are different animated \"patterns\" but each individual key only has one color that\'s either on or off.','2021-12-19 23:16:52',4,18,248),(665,'  I bought one of these keyboards on December 14th 2020.

The pieces are so hard to put back together that we\'ve given up on that keyboard.The second keyboard was used heavily for gaming.

It\'s annoying to say the least when you\'re typing a password and you\'re not sure if caps lock is on or off.

I\'m going to be doing this in list form so you won\'t be reading through paragraphs.- SIZE - This is a full-size keyboard. You can get the dimensions in the item description but just know before you purchase, this keyboard is long.- WEIGHT - Very light as it\'s a fully plastic build. Very little keyboard flex, almost 0 while typing.- TYPING - This is a membrane keyboard, meaning each key is not individual like a mechanical. There is an obvious difference, don\'t believe people who claim that it feels like a mechanical keyboard. It doesn\'t Imagine a slightly mushier MX Brown switch. That all being said, it\'s a joy to type on, requiring very little effort to press the key. The key travel is not as linear (linear = bad) as other membrane keyboards, there is a definite tactile bump when you press a key.- RGB - One of the best parts of this keyboard. There are a bunch of pre-set configurations for the 3 sections. That means 1/3 of the keyboard will always be the same color, you do not have individual key colors. You can read all about the modes on Corsair\'s website, but the ease of use while changing colors is pretty solid. It can be all one color, 2 different colors, 3, or you can have it cycle through the colors in 3 different speeds.- FEATURE SET - Obviously this is not going to have the same features as something like a K70. What you do get is RGB coloring, very solid membrane keys, volume and playback controls, as well as 6 different macro keys to bind to one, or multiple keys in a row. (Meaning you could bind the first Macro to type out a word)- BONUS - This can be seen as a pro or a con. There is no external software you need to download to use this keyboard. It has built in memory for your LED modes and macro functions. I would really have liked a software option if only to control the features the board already comes with, but without the slight hassle of changing settings through keystrokes.Overall absolutely amazing keyboard for $50. If you don\'t mind losing mechanical switches, there\'s very little to complain about with this keyboard.I will respond to any questions I get on this review for the next few months.','2020-09-10 03:00:00',5,16,250),(673,'  colors are amazing,just wish purple and cyan were a little brighter. easy to set a custom settings and adjust speeds,this keyboard doesn\'t slip around and i can easily see the keys in the dark, the detachable hand guard is a plus and doesn\'t impede my use of the keyboard. overall i\'d say this keyboard is a very good buy.','2021-07-30 04:00:00',5,10,250),(674,'  Reasons I bought mine:Competitive price at $50 USDQuiet high profile keysIncluded wrist restNo software needed for RBG lightingProgrammable keysIncluded media buttonsIt’s quiet, it’s beautiful, the keys do feel a bit slick and like a potential grease magnet but that just means it’s up to me to keep my area clean.The included wrist rest does feel cheap, it’s like a mostly hollow piece of attachable plastic with a little rubber grip texture on top, but it was freely included unlike other keyboards.  However as a negative I do see myself replacing the wrist rest with something more comfortable in the future.I haven\'t been able to test out the programmable keys yet so no comment there.I hate loud keyboards!  I know the signature cherry key click is a must for many in the mechanic keyboard fandom (the k55 is NOT a mechanical keyboard for the record).  But I love the tactical feedback when typing without the loud clacking.  The keys feel great to press and naturally are obviously louder than low profile keyboards.  But this keyboard doesn\'t have that drag and heavy typing experience that comes with low profile keys.I bought this on black Friday for $40.47 (that\'s with free shipping and US tax). Even at full price after all the research I\'ve done this is the most competitive expensive but budget friendly high end keyboard.  It looks so professional, but it\'s decorative enough that even with the lights off it\'s a subtle flair of design to add to any office space without that in your face \"gamer\" aesthetic.','2021-12-19 23:16:54',5,13,250),(675,'  My favorite, most used keyboard in my office is my Das 4 Professional Soft Tactile MX Brown Mechanical Keyboard. I mention this so that you could have an idea as to what I look for in a keyboard. Although Das does make an illuminated keyboard, Das Keyboard Prime 13 White LED Backlit, at $129.00 it’s a bit too steep for most of us. I wanted an illuminated keyboard for home use so I could use it at night without disturbing anyone by having to keep the overhead lights on.I ended up buying 4 keyboards looking for the one that not only had good backlighting but also good typing action making it easy to see at night and easy to type on. I wanted to keep the price to around $50.00 – so here is what I bought in order:Perixx PX-1100 ($59.99)The keyboard has serious flaws that significantly interfere with it\'s stated purpose. It is supposed to be illuminated so that it could be used in a dark room. It specifically states that it has key and letter illumination which it does but here lies the problem - the illumination is very uneven with some keys being very bright and others just an inch or two away being very dim. As an example, the left arrow key on my keyboard was very bright while the right arrow key was barely visible especially since the keys next to it were so bright! Another factor is the brightness surrounding the keys which in some areas is brighter than the keys themselves which makes it more difficult to read them. This keyboard apparently has \"zone illumination\" meaning that it has just a few LED\'s lighting up the keys and in some places, near the edge of the zones, there are dim areas - very dim areas, even with the brightness at maximum. If you\'re buying this for the illumination to make it easier to read in a dark room, look elsewhere. If you want a cool looking, colorful keyboard that has relatively good good typing action this is your keyboard, it is heavy, well built, has good typing action and poor lighting. This was the first one I bought and I was very disappointed with it, hence the mediocre rating.Azio – Vision Large Font Keyboard ($29.99)This keyboard has large font: letters, numbers and symbols making it very easy to read in a darkened room. The lighting is even throughout the entire keyboard, there are no bright or dark areas and you can easily change the color of the keys for the entire keyboard or within the 5 lighting zones. For people with vision impairments, this is your keyboard. It is easy to use, set-up and change colors. The typing action on it is very unsatisfying for me as the keys are larger than standard keys so my fingers are not used to the spacing. Also, the height of the keys is somewhat shallower than standard keys and the resistance when you type is “mushy” at least for me. That said, for visually impaired people who are used to the common $15 to $20 keyboard this will be fine for you and at $30, it is a bargain.Logitech K740 – Fullsize Illuminated Slim Keyboard ($59.99)This keyboard is very slim in fact, the travel of the keys when you type is minimal and they are very shallow which I am not used to so I found typing on it unsatisfying. The keyboard reminds me of the one on my inexpensive, compact laptop which gets the job done when I’m traveling but is not designed for serious typing. The illumination however is excellent, bright white and very legible. Set-up is simple and adjusting the brightness is straight forward. If my “go-to” keyboard wasn’t so good, I probably wouldn’t have an issue with this one. Once you have typed on a quality keyboard with mechanical switches you get spoiled! At $60 on sale, I was underwhelmed.Corsair K55 Gaming Keyboard ($47.99)This keyboard basically met my expectations for typing feedback and illumination for the price but it’s far from perfect. When you first connect it to your computer you will be met with an over the top moving display of colors flowing across the entire keyboard which is very distracting and thankfully easily changed with just a few key strokes. You can make it all one color if you wish and choose the color you want or make each zone a different color. The keyboard is light weight like most cheap keyboards, lighter even than the non-illuminated Dell keyboard that it replaced but it gets the job done. The first thing I noticed is that the illumination is crisp and even throughout the keyboard. The letters and symbols are centered on the keys and a bit bolder in font than average keyboards. The keys are not individually illuminated but there are enough LED’s to give it an even appearance. The lighting around the keys is somewhat bright but not to the point of making them difficult to read as on the Perixx. Although the keys themselves are not mechanical, they feel somewhat mechanical giving it a nice tactile experience. The keys have the same height as one would find on a good standard keyboard and have about the same travel as well, so it is a good keyboard to type on or use for gaming or both!There are many illuminated keyboards out there and I spent hours shopping on Amazon and reading reviews trying to finds one that would be right for me. For some people, the typing action may be secondary and so for them, the best buy would be the Azio Vision Large Font Keyboard which at $29.99 is a bargain. It is the easiest by far to read under any conditions and very easy to use/set-up. The Logitech at $60 is also very easy to read but it is twice the price of the Azio. That said, the keys are standard size and it is very well made. For me, the Corsair K55 was the best compromise; although the Azio and the Logitech are easier to read, the Corsair is also easy to read, they are just a bit better in visibility but when I considered typing feel and speed , the Corsair wins.I hope this helps some of you make the right buying decision.Art','2019-11-18 14:15:00',5,5,250),(676,'  I have this keyboard paired with my Corsair M65 mouse over an MM200 mouse mat, and I absolutely love it.  After a solid 12+ years with a Logitech Elite keyboard, a coffee spill took it out and I wanted a straightforward and well built replacement with a cable hookup to suit my workspace that didn\'t cost an arm and a leg.  This board is just the right size, and the tactile feel is great - the keys have almost a matte rubber feel to them that is grippy and resists smudging from the oils on your fingers.  The keystroke is a satisfying muted \"plunk\" but not the over the top click-clack sound of a mechanical board or older plastic components.  Overall just feels very robust.  I originally didn\'t care much about the LED lighting but I have to admit its pretty cool and compliments the lighting in my M65 to make for a pretty trick desktop appearance at night.  I\'m not a big fan of the column of \"G\" keys up the left side...I tend to hit them a lot by accident when making a reach for the CTRL or Shift keys but I\'m sure I\'ll get used to it.','2021-12-05 15:29:15',5,15,250),(677,'  I am not a gamer, so cannot speak for the appropriateness of this product for that use. I bought this to replace a Logitech MK530 whose letters had rubbed off over time to the point that even for my adequate touch typing skills, it was inconvenient at times, especially working at night in my home office where I usually have dimmer, indirect lighting. Having become used to (or spoiled) by backlit keyboards on my Surface Pro 3 and other laptops, I had decided that this was a feature I would like in a replacement keyboard.With that in mind, I first looked at Logitech\'s offerings since I already had a unified receiver that I had been using with my old keyboard and trackball. Unfortunately, I didn\'t really find anything that particularly struck me that wasn\'t huge like their wave keyboards (which are very good, by the way, but too big for this particular space). Since the keyboard would be used in close proximity to my Surface Dock, I expanded my search to include wired keyboards, of which there were scores to consider. I did not want a mechanical keyboard as I find the clicking annoying, especially late at night with others sleeping in adjoining rooms, so ruled those out early on. After reading countless reviews both here and on other sites, I settled on this one as it seemed to offer the best combination of typing experience, lighting control (OK, big cool factor) and size for my needs.I was very happily not disappointed. Typing is a joy on this keyboard. The keys are responsive, with good travel, and it has my preferred straight Enter key rather than the larger upside-down L shape preferred by some manufacturers. For me the advantage there is that all my other keyboards have the straight Enter Key and larger right shift key, so there was no awkward relearning curve, or challenges with switching between keyboards, which I do frequently with my own and clients\' different devices. I also liked the fact that unlike most gaming keyboards, this did not have the extra bold W A S D key letters, which I simply found aesthetically unpleasing.This keyboard has six programmable keys in a vertical column to the left of the main keyboard section. While these were primarily intended for gamers, they are also very useful in a more traditional office environment to create quick access to specific programs or functions. For me, I used one to replace the Calculator shortcut on my Logitech keyboard, then used others to summon my most-used programs like Excel, Word and my Epson scanner. They work very well for that, but the downside is retraining my left hand that the far upper left key is NOT Esc, nor is the far lower left key Ctrl. Other than that minor inconvenience, the programmable keys add an extra level of customization and efficiency that is quite welcome. My one suggestion here to Corsair is that they create a software program to make customizing these programmable keys easier for the less technical user. I had to research this online and found that creating shortcuts to start programs with these macro keys is somewhat of a roundabout process. In essence, you need to create a shortcut for the program you wish to launch, assign it a shortcut key combination, then record a macro of that shortcut to the key you want to assign. Not exactly the most straight-forward way of doing things, but it does the job. There\'s an opportunity for Corsair or an enterprising programmer here.The backlit lighting control is superb and quite extensive. Essentially you have three lighting zones, each of which can display up to seven different colors. There are quite a few pre-programmed choices, both for color and fading effects, as well as the ability to customize to your heart\'s content. If you are so inclined, you can quite literally spend 30-40 minutes or longer playing around with the different lighting combinations and probably still not exhaust all the possibilities. Take some time and have fun with this. It is definitely at the upper end on the coolness scale.One (for me) con, was the size of the lettering on the movement keys in between the main alpha keyboard and the number pad. In the interest of continuing their pseudo future looking typeface, which apparently assumes that pseudo future users have perfect eyesight, the lettering on these keys is uncomfortably small for my sixty-something year-old eyes. This should be a relatively easy fix for Corsair to implement, and would also make those keys more visible to gamers as well.Overall, this is a wonderful keyboard at a reasonable price, that will serve well for all but perhaps the most selective of gamers, and is an excellent replacement for mainstream users who desire something a little beyond the ho-hum run-of-the-mill basic keyboard, The typing experience is easily one of the best I\'ve found in over three decades of computer work.','2017-08-09 09:00:00',1,5,250),(678,'  For 50 dollars you can\'t beat this keyboard. The RGB is very nice, you can setup the lights to scroll, to pulse, you can set how fast they scroll, you can set the colors in 3 different areas individually ( left, middle, and right) you can make it all one color, like all Red or all blue...The keys are not mechanical so don\'t expect the sharp click of a mechanical keyboard but they don\'t feel cheap either, I like it better this way because a mechanical keyboard is very noisy and I find that anoying. Great value for your money it also comes with a detachable arm rest.','2021-03-14 17:00:00',5,20,250),(679,'  - Major malfunctions with Steam- Causes games to momentarily crashThe keyboard by itself and/or the iCUE software will interfere with Steam software. You will experience crashes, extremely long startup time (for the Steam program), and Steam Controller loss of input. You can expect other games to crash as well. I have my keyboard hooked up to a USB hub, so whenever this happens, I just turn off the keyboard and everything resumes normal functioning.','2021-01-05 23:30:00',5,19,252),(680,'  I\'ve gamed on PC for 3+ decades.  Used to be a solid mechanical keyboard advid player.  Well, since carpal tunnel surgery a few years ago, I just can\'t type on mechanical any more without pain.  So I was tossed to the world of membrane keyboards whether I liked it or not.That said, I\'ve grown to love membrane keyboards.  My favorite for just typing is the Logitech K750.  But for gaming that keyboard is slow and often misses key presses in the heat of the action.  Terrible.  I\'ve been looking for a keyboard up to the task of gaming yet still provide a light key press and most of all to be quiet as my children have often asked me to stop typing when they are studying or doing other work that they clicking bothers them.This keyboard is not the most quiet by any means, the K750 being the most quiet I\'ve ever used.  But compared to other styles, it is extremely more quiet than those.  Plus, the key response is awesome for the key press height for a membrane style keyboard.If you need less noise, and love to game, this is the key board for you.  Hands down.','2021-12-19 23:16:49',5,17,252),(681,'  So far after using it for a few hours in Black Ops 4, I’m really enjoying this keyboard. It’s responsive the way a keyboard should be. I went with the linear switches and I was quite impressed with how quiet they are. My Space bar has noticeable rattle but everything else feels and sounds great. Yes, it’s a plastic keyboard and if you’re use to aluminum bodied keyboards at first glance you might feel a bit turned off especially considering how light it is. Don’t let this deter you from making this purchase. I came from a Durgod Venus, another 60% keyboard. I won’t go into depth on my experience with it but if you can find my review, it’s worth reading. Overall, I’m more than satisfied with my purchase. I was a little put off by some of these reviews on YouTube but at the end of the day, a lot of that doesn’t even matter.Pros• lightweight (great for portability)• linear switches are in comparison to Cherry Silent Reds but feel and sound better• fastest switches on the market• Synapse offers great customizationCons• plastic build• Space bar has noticeable rattle• no dust coverSeriously, if that’s all I can think of for reasons why you shouldn’t buy this keyboard then that’s telling you something. I’ll come back and update after 3 months for a final verdict but so far it’s getting a recommendation from me.','2021-12-19 23:16:50',1,8,252),(682,'  I just want to put this out there, this keyboard is NOT a scam. Hear me out about this keyboard. Razer is a huge company in the gaming scene of many games (Fortnite for me).  Seeing their name pop up everywhere gives me comfort when I buy their products.Queue 1 week ago, my slow, old, ugly keyboard was really not keeping up with the speed I needed and wanted in game (Fortnite). I needed a new one and Razer came to mind.  Swing all the pros dominate and put down enemies with this keyboard really pushed my desire for the thing.  BUT I didn’t want to be dumb so like any person, I watched reviews, read reviews, and even checked more commercials.  This is the time I start to doubt this keyboard.After seeing tons of videos about how bad this keyboard was, I really worried if I should fall into Razer’s hands and buy this keyboard. After days of conflict, I decided to buy it. Seeing almost every pro use it made me think if it really was that bad.  I won’t regret this decision.Once this keyboard arrived, I found myself in love. All the things that the people had said were not true at all.  I even put on HyperX Pudding key caps and they still worked.  The Razer Synapse software was easy, convenient, and well-designed. Though the RGB could have been better and brighter, it will still satisfy your hunger. The switches were awesome. They were so fast at 1.0 mm actuation point that I was blown away. The small form factor also benefits players like me (in Fortnite).  The weight did not bother me at all and the keyboard didn’t “slide” at all (though I did put it on my mousepad).  The look is sleek and minimalistic and you can see the letters clearly.  Overall, please buy this keyboard if you are an FPS gamer. It is so worth it and you will not regret it.However there are a few things I must mention: I recommend putting this on your mousepad to stabilize the keyboard and dampen vibrations making it feel “faster”.  Also, I recommend downloading Chroma Studio for better control of your RGB in your Razer Synapse software. Lastly, I’d recommend staying on the original keycaps that the keyboard comes with because they are so perfectly grippy, comfortable, and sleek.That’s it from me. I really hope you do consider this keyboard because I did and I did not regret it. I hope you all stay safe during these times and cave in to your Gaming desires.  Thanks for listening and have a great day!','2021-12-19 23:16:51',5,17,252),(683,'  Razer has been listening which is good but this board has a mass amount of flex for a 60 percent board it feels kinda cheap. Optical switches may last longer but you’re not going to even notice the speed in game compared to an Mx silver or red for instance. The board doesn’t grip to my desk like the gmmk or ducky mini I own so with the light weight etc it shifts around easy even on a mouse mat that I placed down to try a different surface. As soon as I plugged in the keyboard it wanted to install the bloat ware known as Synapse and it won’t save your profile etc without that software. The mecha mini overall is a much better build and quality board. My vortex poker felt much better overall, so in this price range it’s competition is a much better value and build easily and your paying more for this board cause your buying into the said Razer tax.','2021-12-19 23:16:52',1,16,252),(684,'  I have used many different types of keyboards from Razer. I have used the Black-Widow Ultimate, the Ornata, and the standard Huntsman. Out of all of them this is the best, but I would highly recommend paying a bit more, and getting the red linear switches. They are far superior to the clickily purple switches. The linear switches are very quite especially for a mechanical keyboard because it has sound dampeners on the switches. It\'s the best typing experience that I have had so far, and unlike the first gen version of this switch Razer has made vast improvements to the second gen version found in this board. They are not as easy to actuate so you do not get as many false presses as before. It is an expensive board, but overall I feel it is worth it. Another point worth mentioning is it has on board memory so you do not need to use Synapse in order to get your lighting effects to save. This is very important as many people including myself hate synapse so it is great not having to use it. I would say if the 130 dollar price does not scare you and you want a good quite mechanical keyboard then look no further than the Razer Huntsman 60%.','2021-12-19 23:16:53',2,20,252),(685,'  Razer has still not fixed the driver issue with AMD based CPUs and this keyboard, your computer will take 10mins just to log on and start up and after that you cant click the start button or open firefox or use the FN key.This is a known issue with Razer Huntsman Mini and AMD based CPUs that Razer has not fixed for months now.To confirm this issue I tested on my intel based desktop and it worked without any issues then I plugged it into my AMD laptop and issues happened for 10mins.I also tested another AMD desktop in my house and the same issues.IF you don\'t mind waiting 10mins every time you turn on your computer to use your keyboard then go ahead and purchase if you do mind then go by another keyboard without driver issues.','2021-12-19 23:16:54',5,2,252),(686,'  The keyboard itself is great. I love it, I really do. The keys have a great feel to them and they keyboard sounds and feels awesome. That being said, the software that you need to use it is some the worst garbage I have ever installed onto my PC. Razer Synapse is absolute garbage and will just constantly ruin the functionality of my PC. every few hours or so my mouse or keyboard will have crippling and unbeleivably frustrating issues that wont resolve unless i completely restart the software, which is often diffucult because my devices won\'t even work properly so that I can navigate to the software to close it. All in all I really like the keyboard a lot but razer synapse is so unreliably broken and infuriating that I have to give this keyboard a 2 star review as synapse is vital to using it. This software appears to have been written by toddlers and makes me want to rip my hair out. Not worth the hassle of putting what is essentially a virus on your computer. Stay away unless you are fine with not installing synapse and therefore not being able to customize any aspect of your keyboard. I cannot stress how mind numbingly bad this trash software is, I have dealt with malware that was less annoying and frustrating.','2021-12-19 23:16:55',4,17,252),(687,'  This Huntsmen Mini is simply a phenomenal 60% keyboard that works wonderfully for gaming especially and just typing in general. The linear switches are so quiet  (barely audible) and the feel and overall function of the keys couldn\'t be any better optimized. Very satisfying typing experience, makes you want to type for the hell of it.The build quality is top notch easily meeting or exceeding  the build quality of other similarly priced keyboards despite being made mostly of \"plastic\" as it this somehow matters.... The bottom line is that the keyboard is robustly built with tight tolerances as one would expect.There is no \"wobble\" in the keys to include the space bar which is also rock solid like all the other keys so the compliant of \"key wobble\" doesn\'t hold true with my example for what it\'s worth.','2021-12-19 23:16:56',5,15,252),(688,'  First off, this is a great product overall and is a stark difference from a traditional, non-mechanical, wireless keyboard.  Very happy with the purchase and the product as a whole.  It is very responsive and I have noticed a big improvement while gaming - even typing this review is more enjoyable with the Razer red linear optical switches!That said, I did have a couple of defects with mine and had to request an exchange - I would expect this case was an exception as I have been very happy with my Razer Mamba Wireless mouse and have heard generally favorable things about Razer products.  If you came here wondering if you should get it, I would say to go for it if it checks all the boxes for your needs in a mechanical and/or 60% keyboard.For those curious about my issue/experience, read on...after the first time using the keyboard, I noticed the \"U\" key was lit up white instead of the RGB lighting I customized in Synapse (cycled through a few light settings to check).  I was not able to fully isolate the issue, but mainly noticed it while playing Apex Legends.  I have all in game lighting affects turned off so it doesn\'t sync with games so I am not sure what the issue was.  After booting/waking up my PC, the keyboard is fine, or when waking the keyboard after it times out (setup for timeout after 5 minutes).  I also noticed it while playing Warzone the next day.  My other issue was a bit more concerning, but less \"severe\": 3 keycaps were partially not shining through with the back lighting - a very blatant QA issue that should not happen with a product at this price point.  The \"e\" on the \"esc\" key, the \"b\" on the \"tab\" key and the \"p\" on the \"caps\" key all had black spots that were blocking light from shining through.  I took off the \"esc\" keycap and saw some black plastic in the corner stuck beneath the white/clear coating (below the thin, black top of the key is a clear/white layer for the shine through on the letters/numbers/symbols whereas the edges are the thicker black plastic).  I have included a picture of the underside of the problem keycaps.  I gently tried to nudge the black plastic off as not to break the keycap, but it wouldn\'t budge.  The \"tab\" and \"caps\" keys have a square of the clear/white coating completely chipped away.  Not sure how that is resulting in the blocked light unless the clear/white coating diffuses the light, but it does look slightly different than the \"esc\" keycap defect.  I ended up chatting with Razer support and was told I needed to open an exchange with the reseller.  Not the answer I was hoping for, but I guess I wasn\'t really sure what to expect in the first place (sending me 3 new keycaps seems cost prohibitive and does not seem as effective of a solution - especially if the lighting on the \"U\" key persists).  Already have the exchange confirmed with Amazon and will send the defective one back ASAP.  Overall seemingly minor issues, but disappointing given the price point and overall reputation of this brand.','2021-12-19 23:16:57',4,10,252),(689,'            Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n        \n\n\n   quick keybinding, sweet informative keypads, and Razer switches which grant the user a much more \"click clack\" and soft resistance in terms of typing.Gaming affiliated?

It is hideously overpriced. I wonder about the reviews. For the first time, I did not get an answer to a question I asked (except one clearly bogus answer) and I think that\'s because there aren\'t real customers.The keyboard has the wave pattern as the default (why???????). The manual (very minimal) does not explain how to change it. To get to a static pattern, press the logo key to the left of the control key on the bottom right of the keyboard and then one of the function keys that lights up (such poor design).The action of the keys is OK but no better than the refurbished Corsair that I wanted but was out of stock at the time I needed to order. I just ordered another Corsair, which is back in stock, and will give this one away. The Corsair has a nicer sound wheel. The one one this keyboard is too small and you have to think about using it. For games, I often change the level of sound so this is important to me.There is no Indication of caps being on (I know it shares this design flaw with other keyboards, but for the money...).This keyboard is kind of a rip off if you ask me.This review, as well as all the others were removed.

It is also magnetic so you don\'t have to worry about breaking tabs or having cheap creaking.The USB pass-through is MASSIVELY useful. I use the slot to apply the USB wireless transmitter for the Steelseries 650 mouse.What else is there to say? Just buy it.','2021-12-19 23:16:54',4,20,254),(694,'  I was very excited to be using a mechanical keyboard for work and gaming, however, this keyboard stopped started having issues within a month and a half of use.  The first problem was that the keyboard turned itself on and tried cycling through its macro settings by itself rendering it unusable.  This was fixed by doing a factory reset and uninstalling the SteelSeries software that you can download to edit the macros and settings.  After two days, the same issue crept up again so I contacted customer support, did some more in-depth file work and once again, worked for a day or two before the space bar stopped receiving inputs.  With the keyboard essentially broken after less than two months of use, I\'m not too impressed and I\'d urge users to really think about their purchase.  This is a $150 paperweight.Thankfully, SteelSeries reps are somewhat speedy in their response and I\'m hoping to get a replacement to see if that works.  If the new one they ship out does work for a longer time frame, I\'ll change my review as it was a very nice keyboard to use for hte time I had it.  With that also said, do yourself a favor and buy directly from steelseries so you can get a refund when you ask for it.','2019-11-18 14:15:00',1,4,254),(695,'  **UPDATE: After using this keyboard for EXACTLY 1 year (coincidence?), the Home key suddenly has a malfunctioning LED and will not display any blue/purple/pink hues.  Awaiting a reply from SteelSeries, but I imagine I\'m stuck with the defective switch and will likely purchase a different brand as a replacement.  Two stars have been deducted from my original review.What I love about the SteelSeries Apex 7 keyboard:1. Vibrant LED lights with superb visibility2. Ability to customize different light profiles that launch automatically with various PC programs/games3. OLED display that can be customized with logos or animated GIFs4. Magnetic wrist rest that detaches easily and is extremely simple to clean (no textured grooves to collect dirt!)5. SteelSeries software requires minimal CPU background usage compared to HyperX software on previous keyboard6. Red switches are clicky yet aren\'t obtrusive.  I know when I\'ve pressed a key, but the whole house isn\'t alerted that mom is gaming yet again.7. Very comfortable for my middle-aged fingers and wrists8. Looks nice with my SteelSeries dual surface prism mousepad9. SteelSeries Engine software is way more reliable than Razer Synapse10. Caps Lock key glows white when activated, which is a nice feature.What could be improved:My main gripe is that there are absolutely zero instructions included about the OLED display and the menu/functions within it.  I initially had trouble loading the profiles I created in the SteelSeries Engine software to the keyboard, but I eventually fumbled through the OLED display menu on the keyboard and figured out how to load/activate each profile.  The process is a bit cumbersome.  SteelSeries support keeps promising me a comprehensive guide to the OLED display but has yet to deliver.Other than that, I really have no complaints and am very pleased with the Apex 7 vs. my old HyperX Alloy Elite.  I didn\'t opt for the Apex Pro keyboard because, as a middle-aged mom who only games casually, I felt no use for fully customizable switches.  I\'m a huge fan of the game Super Animal Royale, and I have won many matches with my new Apex 7!  If SteelSeries would only make gaming earbuds (I get headaches from headsets) and a mouse with a tilting scroll wheel, I could completely ditch Razer and game 100% with SteelSeries gear.  Just buy the Apex 7 keyboard already, it\'s pretty spiffy!  :)','2021-12-05 15:29:15',5,11,254),(696,'  4 month old keyboard. Nice keyboard, simple design, somewhat comfortable. Noisy keystrokes, definitely not quiet. One of the feet broke. Two, small 2mm round circular plastics molded to the feet secured to the base of the keyboard providing lift, broke. The little circular round tab broke off, feet can\'t stay put. Cheap sh1t quality plastic providing the support to the keyboard. Email SteelSeries for support for a replacement. Shot me down stating no replacement, sorry for your inconvenience. No response afterward. Terrible customer service. Stay away from this company.','2017-08-09 09:00:00',1,13,254),(697,'  I just picked up this apex 7 along with a rival 310 as part of my desktop refresh. I\'ve gone through a ton of cheap keyboards, and wanted to go through the mechanical keybaord experience. The first thing I noticed was the heftiness of the metal build. The keys also felt solid under my fingers when I typed. I got the red switch, which is supposed to be the quietest version, but the keys are still noticeably loud compared to its non-mechanical counterparts.For the additional features: the magnetic wrist support seems okay, although I might end up not using it if it eats up too much desk real estate. The LED display and multimedia volume wheel on the top left are other examples of things that are cool, but probably not what I\'m going to utilize very frequently.Overall, it\'s a solid keyboard with a long long lifetime even when under constant duress from gaming. It was a bit pricey at $140, but worth it for such a workhorse product.','2021-03-14 17:00:00',2,5,254),(698,'            Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n        \n\n\n   I have absolutely loved this keyboard which is important when you pay $160 for a keyboard.  I love the small oled screen (which i put some custom graphics on.  I love the customization of the lighting which is saying a lot for me since i\'m not a fan of RGB.  I love the cherry red keys and the ergonomics of the keyboard.  unfortunately I can\'t in good faith personally recommend this expensive keyboard.  why? 4 months out of warranty and it glitches on and off over and over until i unplug it and plug it back in.  this will happen several times a day and then it may go a couple of days with out doing it.  When it does this the keyboard is unusable until it\'s unplugged and plugged back in.  there\'s also several keys that the rgb has stopped working for some colors.  I am currently wait to see if steelseries will go ahead and warranty it but I am not holding my breath.  If they do, then that tells me they truly believe in their products and i really could in good faith recommend this keyboard again.  it would be different if this was a couple of years out of warranty but its only 4 months past the warranty and for a $160 keyboard, it should last far longer.  I have keyboards (one was the first light up key keyboard from 2000) that are over 20 years old and still work as they should.','2021-01-05 23:30:00',5,11,254),(699,'  I did lots of research before purchasing this keyboard and got a great deal here on Amazon for it. It\'s a beautiful keyboard with some wonderful features. The display is very cool and the keys making typing so easy and smooth. The lighting is gorgeous and fully adjustable. I wanted so badly for this keyboard to just work, but here\'s the issue that forced me to return it:If you want to use this keyboard with a usb switch (kvm-style) on any machine with a Win 10 OS, look elsewhere! I just could not get it to work consistently. It will work on Win 10 for a while, then it will start blinking, which renders it unusable. I had to switch it back and forth to make it stable again, but it wouldn\'t last. I tried a few different tricks I tracked down online including direct connection (which is definitely not a long-term fix, since I need to use it on the home and work PCs--  One of which, being Linux, worked flawlessly), changing power settings in Windows, and disabling the Steelseries software app, but nothing worked for more than a few minutes under load.Such a great keyboard--  I sure hope they work out these issues one day because I\'d love to try it again sometime, but for me, I need the primary purpose of the keyboard to just work every time.I have nothing but praise for Amazon who talked this over with me and resolved this for me. So glad I bought this here. I\'ll be buying an alternative keyboard through Amazon, as well, with even more confidence having had such a good experience come out of this unfortunate situation.I\'ve settled for the Razer Blackwidow Elite, which is nice from a typing perspective, but requires the proprietary software for lighting effects (where the Apex does not) and is not on the same level of solid quality as the Apex, nor are the switches as smooth, but it will do for now. I\'m going to keep an eye out for the next Apex from Steelseries in hopes that it will not have the same issue with Win 10 that the 7 has. I still believe Steelseries makes the best overall gaming keyboard and look forward to trying it again someday.','2021-12-19 23:16:49',2,8,255),(700,'  I was retiring my super loud green switch keyboard and wanted another RAZER. Found this one and didn\'t realize it was one until after it arrived. I am glad I didn\'t dismiss it because of brand!Pros:-Large! It\'s full sized.-Quieter than a green switch!! I can think again!-Feels high quality. It\'s solid.-The tiny screen can be programmed to show whatever you want, even gifs. I have mine display the game I\'m playing or program I\'m using!-Has a volume raise/lower wheel. Definitely a feature I would have missed from my old one.-Also has a pause button for your music/video!Cons:-Some of the lighter colors appear washed out.-I wish the wrist rest had more padding. It\'s basically rubber and I dislike it.I notice no latency when gaming, and love that I can actually use the software to change the colors when I open a program or game. This means I can set my hotkeys to be different for a number of programs and games, such as my classes or Minecraft. It\'s really useful!','2014-02-18 06:00:00',1,2,255),(701,'  UPDATE: After trying to get support from Steelseries, they (SteelSeries, NOT Amazon)  wanted videos of the broken key, documentation, photos and stated that I would get an RMA.  They then decided that I should just send it back.  They would repair or give a credit for something from their store.  No thanks.  Going back to a different manufacturer that supports their own products and doesn\'t treat the customer as the problem.I have no idea how this has such a high score.The first one I got had trouble with the Question Mark key.  It would constantly do a repeating backslack.I returned and got a replacement, the second had a dead Nine key.I have zero clue how it can be only me.  I tried with different keyboards and no trouble.  Tried the Apex 7 on different computer and same issue.Granted that this is really comfortable and had a great wrist rest.  But if a key doesn\'t work, no matter how comfy it is, it would be worthless.','2021-12-19 23:16:51',3,7,255),(702,'  The keyboard is absolutely riddled with problems. These weren’t user inflicted problems either. I made the switch to PC recently and unfortunately couldn’t find the time to practice using mouse and keyboard; so I stuck with controller as I mostly play COD and OW. So the most action the keyboard saw was light typing for essays. The issues it had were some of my keys would type random letters and activate the tab key; so trying to write an essay was frustrating when you needed to use a quotation mark and instead it would indent your paragraph and type a whole bunch of letters. As pictured above though it looks like I just typed random letters, this is literally what spews our whenever I press my colon, quotation and question mark keys. Also the rubberized stoppers on the keyboard that keep it from moving on surfaces, fall off very easily. The scroll wheel was very fragile and would constantly remain pressed in, which mutes your audio and you can’t unmute it from windows since it prioritizes the keyboard first. Their customer support was very unhelpful as they gave the stereotypical simple solutions to your problem. So it would take about several responses before they finally worked through the whole list of common solutions to customer problems and ask specific questions about your problem. These issues are not present at first and mine arose just after the Amazon return date was expired, so I can’t even return it. I would suppress my excitement for its looks and look for a more reliable option.','2021-12-19 23:16:52',1,11,255),(703,'  Quick to the point, the key layout is to close in space, more like a laptop keyboard.  The biggest issue I had was not having an Fn key on the keyboard.  Instead, there are two Windows keys on each side of the space bar.  I reached out to customer support via email and they stated there is no way to customer program the key default (I was trying to program the right side windows key to work as a function key).  I was able to find a work around by plugging in a separate keyboard and using that to customer program the key function with the software.  But I still ended up returning the keyboard.  The biggest issue is the close proximity of the keys.  Trying to use the keyboard for work during the day and gaming at night proved not to be a good combination.  If you have smaller hands, the keyboard could work for you.','2021-12-19 23:16:53',5,6,255),(704,'  First I noticed was the Firmware kept crashing, so I did what Steele Series recommend and reverted the Firmware. After a month each key required different pressures to activate them, then later on I noticed that some keys, the most used one, required a further key press than others and frequently would not activated until bottoms out. Because of this, some keys that active higher on the stroke repeat while typing. Finally, the deal breaker, the scroll wheel to cycle the menu. It broke completely. For the premium Price, a keyboard so inconsistent, and one that does NOT have a Print Screen, Scroll Lock or many other keys should be sold for half of what they are retailing it for. Don\'t bother with this keyboard, Try Razer. I had no luck with the poor quality of Logitech Gaming keyboards as well.','2021-12-19 23:16:54',1,11,255),(705,'  I dont know how hard other people smash their keyboards after losing a match of fortnite but this thing is a dream.

It has served well as someone with a lighter keystroke than king kong.','2021-12-19 23:16:55',1,8,255),(706,'  I don\'t know why people like this model and brand so much. The so-called \"quiet\" red keys are much louder than my other blue-key keyboard by Roccat. The keys on this SteelSeries are very loose to the touch, and longer keys such as \"Shift\" bend and twist during rapid typing. The worst aspect though, is the Spacebar. It makes a loud thunk every time you hit it. It\'s audible throughout the house, and sounds like the keyboard is designed to amplify it like a passive woofer. Probably just the low-quality materials, which feel cheap to the touch. Instead of SteelSeries, I recommend Roccat and Corsair brands.','2021-12-18 19:29:38',3,1,255),(707,'  I\'ve owned this keyboard for a little over a year. I\'ve done maintenance almost 1-2 times a month to keep this keyboard as pristine as possible. Less than 6 months in, I experienced my first key chattering issue. it wasn\'t a big deal back then due to the fact that it was only happening on my \"i\" key but nonetheless, it was quite annoying to deal with. Slowly over the course of the last 3-4 months, the chattering issue spread from being only my \"i\" key to now infecting my k, v, h, m, d and w. Multiple inputs are registered per keystroke which rendered the keyboard basically useless to me.  I created a customer support ticket and had to wait almost 3-4 weeks before I received my initial response. After back and forths for almost an additional month (keep in mind we are now 2 months into the support ticket) they finally offered me a solution. BREAK my current keyboard and send in 20 pictures to prove it was done so they can continue with an RMA, effectively rendering me USELESS for 3 weeks before my keyboard was shipped and delivered, or place a $180 HOLD ON MY BANK ACCOUNT while they shipped out a new keyboard and I was still expected to go through the process of breaking my obviously defected keyboard before they released the hold. This is absolutely malicious and criminal activity from steelseries. I\'m BEYOND angry and I would recommend everyone who sat here and read through this to NEVER PURCHASE A STEELSERIES PRODUCT. IT is NOT worth your time and frustration.','2021-12-19 23:16:57',2,16,255),(708,'  I got this keyboard 3 months ago and was happy from day one. I love the size, the looks, the feel. Everything was great. But today I noticed the LED for the S key was a bit off white while all the others were white. Several hours later and it has gotten progressively worse. It is now a very pale yellow which tells me the blue diode is fading. Its really quite disappointing considering the price of the keyboard. I have some replacement leds on the way so I am hoping I can do the repair. The necessary leds aren\'t extremely easy to come by and I was only able to find common anode at a reasonable price and shipping time. Hopefully common anode is the correct pin out.','2021-12-19 23:16:58',3,16,255),(709,'  When I first got this keyboard, I absolutely loved it. It\'s very nice-looking and bright, and there\'s a million ways you can customize the coloring and lighting. The key presses also felt very smooth and typing on it was a real joy.Unfortunately, after about 5-6 months of use, I started having problems with multiple keys. It started with my Ctrl and Shift keys not registering all the time, which is very frustrating when you try to Ctrl-s to save something and end up with \'s\' characters in your document or code. Now I have several letter keys that do not always register, and my \'r\' and \'u\' key are now chattering/double-tapping. This has become a massive productivity-killer, as I have to correct almost every third or fourth word that I type.I have tried a full factory reset and re-installation of the keyboard\'s software, and have tried pulling up the keycaps of individual keys and pulling junk out and air-dusting around the switches, and nothing has worked. I really wanted to like this keyboard, but this has become extremely frustrating. I would expect better quality and/or durability from a $100 + keyboard.','2021-12-19 23:16:59',4,14,256),(710,'  Ok so the keyboard it self feels good to game on, love the Oled screen feels good.

It seems very different from the K95 Platinum. I don\'t know if I enjoy it more or less than the previous version. I think it sounds a little clunky, but not too bad. The optic switches are insanely fast.I don\'t think there\'s a huge difference between 1000hz polling and 4000hz polling. I\'d like to think I can see a difference with my typing and gaming, but I really can\'t. I don\'t seem to have too much trouble finding the keys without looking at the keyboard, so that\'s a plus.  I also only really type with my thumb and two forefingers, so this keyboard seems to be better, as the keys are less spaced out than the k95 Platinum. The \"U\" key seems to give me a little trouble.The scroll weel is kinda pointless. I can\'t think of a real reason to use it, so it\'s just going to sit on my keyboard looking fancy. I think that if you already have the k95 Platinum, then you should stick with it, especially if you\'re thinking about getting the speed switches for the k100, as they are the exact same switches. The only reason I could see upgrading is for the optic switches, which are super touchy.Going into detail on the optic switches, I swore I wasn\'t going to notice a difference, but I did indeed notice a huge one. Luckily, I\'m already used to speed switches, so this won\'t be too hard to learn. Anyone used to any other switch should avoid this keyboard, unless you are willing to get used to the Speed or OPX switches.When I bought the k95, I was coming from Cherry MX Blues. Anyone with experience with the Blue switches will tell you that they have an extremely clicky actuation point. They have a 2.2mm travel distance with a bottom of 4.0mm and require 50 grams of force to activate. Speeds are a lot quicker. They actuate at 1.2mm with a 3.4mm total travel distance. The force is similar at 45 grams. So as you may guess, it took a long time to get used to the speed and weight at which the Speeds activated.Now, Corsair\'s OPX Switches take the Speeds a bit further. This is both impressive and intimidating, as the Cherry MX Speeds were previously considered the world\'s fastest mechanical switch. OPX actuates at just 1mm, which is insanely low. I can put my lightest touch, not bottoming out, on these switches and they actuate. I assume that, other than being optical and having a faster actuation point, that the rest is similar to the Speeds. I will say that due to how the keyboard and keys are built vs. the k95, typing is much louder on the k100. I would highly suggest some different or custom keycaps.It is a well-rounded keyboard that\'s just a bit pricey for what you get. I don\'t think the wrist rest is anywhere near as well made as the k95. I hope we get a version like the k95 for the k100 in the future. The keys themselves feel... thinner? I dunno. I don\'t think they are. The scroll wheel for audio definitely feels a little cheaper than it\'s previous version. It\'s also hella touchy, moreso than the k95, which was already a problem for me. The media keys feel a lot jankier and wobble, whereas they never did on the k95. This next one is just personal taste, but I think the glass piece on the top center of the keyboard is unneeded, and not very attractive. I don\'t see the point of it, other than to say it has glass to up the price for \"premium build materials\".I can\'t tell you much about the software. You\'ll have to familiarize yourself with the convoluted and over-complicated iCue software. I will say that after upgrading the firmware for the k100, it ported all my macros and lighting effects from the k95, which was a huge plus.If you read this to the bottom, thank you. It was a type test in Word that turned into a very lengthy review. I enjoyed typing on these switches so much that I just kept typing and typing. I will continue to update this review if I run into any problems.Edit 11/19: After about a month of owning this keyboard, there is a slight to glaring flaw, depending on which key this happens to. It\'s avoidable, but still extremely annoying for such a high priced product. The wrist rest will slide up with use over time. Eventually, this will push hard against the keys, either making them feel like they don\'t press, or making them stay down.I ran into this problem a little while ago, but that was when I was moving the keyboard around. This time it inched up by itself and held my alt key down. It was a pain figuring out why my keyboard wasn\'t typing. I seriously thought it broke. Turns out the left side of the wrist rest was pressed up against the left side keys.Corsair, if you read this, please make a K95-style wrist rest. I will gladly buy it over this memory foam nightmare you gave us.','2020-05-22 14:01:00',1,18,256),(712,'  Yes it can play crysis.','2021-12-19 23:16:54',3,5,256),(713,'  GARBAGE. The K100 causes random crashes due to poling and ICUE software. RGB color assignment  to keys doesnt load during post and causes errors during boot.

ICUE IS UNINTUITIVE SLOPWARE','2019-11-18 14:15:00',4,11,256),(714,'  Overall I like the look, feel, and speed of the keyboard. I do take issue with a couple things that I\'d like you to keep in mind.1) Cherry MX Silver switches are significantly more sensitive than I expected. I constantly fat-finger things when I\'m typing.  Sometimes I start turning left, only to realize that just the weight of my ring finger on \"a\" is activating it, when I don\'t even feel that I\'m pressing the key.2) The \"G#\" keys on the far left have messed up my muscle memory. I keep pressing \"G1\" when I mean to hit \"ESC\", and \"G6\" when I mean to hit \"CTRL\".These 2 issues get quite annoying, but I still like it, and will continue to work with it to build new muscle memory.For context, I changed to this keyboard from Mad Catz STRIKE7.UPDATE a week later: I give up.  Switched back to my Mad Catz. I will not be buying Cherry MX Silver in the future.I got over the G keys for the most part, but typing extra letters in every sentence got old quick.Also, not for nothing, iCue really realllly sucks. It is not intuitive, and doesn\'t load the profile you had last, so you have to open and set it every time you turn on your computer. Also, the profiles are saved on the software, not the board, so it\'s full and lifeless unless you\'re running iCue.  What is this, 1997?TL;DR - Cherry MX Silver too sensitive, iCue SUCKS, G-keys are poorly placed. I now have a $230 dust collector.','2021-12-05 15:29:15',5,8,256),(715,'  Gamers buy this keyboard, and what do gamers hate? Reflections, because they are very distracting. Gaming monitors have done away with reflective bezels for this very reason, so it really is quite frustrating and perplexing that Corsair, who is supposed to be the premium gaming peripheral company, would put a mirrored reflective strip at the top of the keyboard, reflecting everything from the monitor onto that strip. It just defies logic why it is there. Very surprised that the hour seems to be amateur hour over at Corsair, at least when it comes to this specific issue.My other gripe is the fact that we have to install 3rd party software to use the G  keys, how the hell is it that they couldn\'t incorporate this in iCUE itself? Most of us already have enough pieces of software on our systems running in the background competing for resources.Other than those things, the keyboard is comfortable, beautiful, sturdy, and the keys feel fantastic (optical version). It sounds like a machine gun when you type, I personally like that, but it may throw some folks off.Would be 5 stars if not for those 2 things.','2017-08-09 09:00:00',5,18,256),(716,'  My first impression is that this thing is just absolutely gorgeous once its all plugged in. The aluminum construction, lightniing fast keycaps, and customizable  cue wheel make this thing just an absolutely awesome keyboard.I had never used MX Cherry \'short\' switches before, and they have more of a mooshy feel than they do a \'snappy\' feel than MX Browns, but I have to admit, after practicing a little bit I like them better than the browns. The short action requires very little effort to actuate, and it ends up adjusting your typing style from a tapping style to a gliding one. I can still burst up to 150WPM easily, which I was only able to achieve using my Das Keyboard Ultimate.It\'s a little expensive. I just happen to be fairly prosperous right now, so I splurged a bit. I imagine to the ordinary consumer looking for a \'dollar per feature\' comparison might find themselves better luck with an off-brand.We\'ll see how this thing holds up to the test of time, but right now I\'m in keyboard heaven.  Thanks Corsair!','2021-03-14 17:00:00',5,5,256),(717,'  TLDR: Premium keyboard loaded with features in a package as solid feeling as it looks.Pros:- Excellent build quality- Smooth optical switches- Up to 8k polling rate (to further take advantage of the optical switches)- Excellent sounding stabilizers right out of the box!- Very nice included wrist rest- Macro (G-key) streamdeck integration- Fully remappable (except for the icue button on the top left)- Double shot PBT keycaps- Standard Bottom row (can use just about any key cap set you want)- Bright RGB lighting with many preset effects and customization (can layer up to 20 effects)- Compatible with iCUE nexus- Can save lighting effects, macros, and profiles directly to the keyboardCons:- The included wrist rest\'s geometric pattern locks in grime quite easilyThoughts:Everything about this keyboard screams PREMIUM and QUALITY! Typing feels fantastic with the new OPX mechanical switches. They\'re smoother than cherry (as are pretty much everything these days) and sound great on the board. The stabilizers feel absolutely fantastic! No rattles at all. Finally! The worst part about corsair keyboards in the past (in my opinion) were the stabilizers. There was nothing you could do to those stupid wires to make them tolerable. The OPX mechanical switches are \"speed\" switches, meaning that they have a higher actuation point than switches you may be used to. Regular reds or linears actuate at about 2mm, where these actuate at 1mm. If you\'re not used to speed switches, you may make a lot of typos or walk off of cliffs alot for a while, but after getting used to them, you can hardly tell they\'re as high actuating as they are. The lighting is very bright and beautiful. I recently tried Razer\'s new huntsman analog, and nothing about it can hold a candle to this keyboard. If you\'re trying to decide between the two, there\'s absolutely no competition there. The wheel in the top left can do various things like adjust lighting, or scrub through music or videos. It\'s a nice little addition. The volume control is also very tight feeling. I\'ve felt many keyboards with dedicated volume wheels that feel real loose, but this one\'s very nice.Conclusion:This is as good of a gaming keyboard as you can get right now. It is absolutely loaded with features in a package that feels as solid as it looks. While being fairly pricy, you definitely get what you pay for with this. I highly recommend getting the optical switches since the other selection is a cherry speed switch anyway. The OPX switch feels great and better takes advantage of the 8k polling rate available on the board (not that mega high polling rates REEEALLY make a huge difference on keyboards). That said, I would recommend the OPX switch over the cherry speed switch because its just a much smoother feeling switch. If you\'ve ever used anything besides cherry, you know everything\'s better than cherry and that\'s no exception here. The cherry switches are very scratchy through their actuation. The OPX switches make a sort springy sound sometimes, usually on rapid presses, but nothing that you feel, so it\'s not enough to recommend against it. The OPX switches also feel lighter, probably because they\'re so much smoother which just feels much better in games.*update 3/16/2021:Corsair has released a new version of iCue that is much more modern, easy to use, and not bad to look at. It\'s more responsive when making changes and adds 8k polling rate to the K100.','2021-01-05 23:30:00',1,15,256),(718,'  So far I\'m loving this keyboard. I\'ve been a loyal Logitech fan for over two decades now and I gotta say it was a tough choice to switch brands after so long. I bought this to replace my G910 which had caps that had broken off and a few keys were starting to false trigger... lots of W\'s while typing, guess from all that gaming WASD pressing.Pros:These keys are pretty amazing. I got the MX Speed version and coming from Roamer G keys, they feel so much more responsive and I feel I can press them faster, they also feel sturdier, but that I can say about overall the keyboard itself. This aluminum body makes it feel solid. The wrist wrest is super comfy, I didn\'t know it was memory foam until I got it, you know it\'s one of those things I really didn\'t bother reading about while doing research. The texture on the key caps is also a nice detail. Volume wheel feels super sturdy too, same with the new Control Wheel.Cons:I\'m not a super fan of their iCUE software. I was trying to setup some macros similar to how I had them on my G910 and spent like 5 mins trying to find how to set the name on one of the Actions I had just created... And then another 10 trying to find how to assign the action to one of the G keys... had to watch a video on their website to realize you have to click on the Action and then click on the Key... Guess I got used to the way it\'s done in the Logitech Gaming Software, which you either right click the key and have a context menu, or you drag and drop an existing Command to a key... a bit more intuitive and user friendly. The software itself feels a bit sluggish, but it\'s not something I\'m going to spend on lots of hours on after I setup my macros and profiles. I do like that I pretty much have as many key assignments as Profiles I create, and also (haven\'t done it yet) but seems you can remap any key, which you couldn\'t do on the Logitech ones.','2013-06-09 11:00:00',5,12,256),(719,'  I bought this keyboard in December 2020. And it came with a two-year \"warranty\"It was a great keyboard until it wasn\'t. In fact, I got about 8 months great use out of it.A few days ago the secondary enter key (near the number pad) became sluggish and started to not return to the full return height. It got progressively worse after another day or two where it would not come back up at all after being pressed.I contacted Corsair for warranty repair or replacement. I was shocked when I saw the curt response from their \"customer service\" representative Reno who stated and I quote:\"This type of damage is not covered by our warranty\".WTFFirst off there was no damage cause by me. This is a switch malfunction.  Perhaps 90 percent of any keyboard is comprised of switches and they are not covered by the warranty?  This is just laughable. Paying about $200 paid for a keyboard that I got 8 months of use out of, is insane, and what\'s more insane is that Corsair will not stand behind their product and warranty.I have been a Corsair customer for years and use and used  many of their products. I have never before had an issue with any of their gear until now.  But I guess I was lucky.And knowing what a sham their warranty is, at least with respect to keyboards, I will certainly think twice about buying any more Corsair products.  Wait, I won\'t think twice. Once is enough. I am done with Corsair.Buyer beware.A copy of their actual response to my warranty ticket is attached.','2014-05-20 05:30:00',5,14,260),(720,'  I\'ve owned tons of Corsair\'s previous keyboards starting with their early monocolor white led k95 to the various other iterations of the K70 and K95 that were released over the years. I\'ve always had some issue with them that made me hope that it would be fixed. The first K95 had problems with the black on the keycaps wearing off and the led lights dying quickly. Later RGB versions seemed to fix the LEDs dying, but introduced issues with a single key press registering multiple keystrokes. Then the quality of the keycaps of newer releases seemingly degraded and were completely loose out of the box. So loose that if you tapped a key too quickly, the keycap would fly off the board. That got old very quickly. Then the K95 RGB Platinum also had the issue of some of the LEDs starting to become really dim compared to the other keys. I switched to the EVGA Z20 after I got fed up with the various issues, but found it had its own host of problems including random disconnecting from the computer and losing power regardless of what USB port I plugged it into.I discovered that Corsair had a new keyboard with a new type of optical switches and decided to give their keyboards one more chance. After some months of use, I have to say this keyboard is fantastic so far and all my previous issues with their keyboards appear to be gone.- The keys feel just right when typing.- The fonts used on the keyboard look a lot better and the keyboard overall has a classier look to it.- The keycaps are not loose in the slightest. They are snugly fitted to the switches and actually takes a bit of effort to pull them off so I\'m not worrying about them flying off the keyboard anymore mid-game or while chatting.- There hasn\'t been a single instance of a single keypress registering multiple keystrokes. So far, the LEDs for these OPX switches have been holding up over the months and I hope they stay that way.- The keycaps are double shot so I don\'t have to worry about the paint on the keys coming off.- Not really a past issue per se, but perhaps due to the new OPX switches, it\'s not as loud when the keys bottom out while typing compared to the Cherry MX switches. An improvement in my opinion, but some people might prefer the louder clickety clack of the Cherry MX switches.As an added bonus, the wrist rest is also their best yet. It must use a memory foam inside as it has yet to flatten out even after applying a lot of pressure on like resting my elbows on it frequently. It\'s a huge improvement over the hard plastic wrist rests with the rubberized coating. It also conveniently snaps right onto the keyboard with magnets.If I were to list any cons, they would be:- Price. This is one expensive keyboard. I have had no issues with it so far, so I\'ll take it over having a cheaper keyboard with problems.- Easy to accidentally press a key if you\'re not careful as they are linear and don\'t require a whole lot of force. Also, they have a VERY short actuation distance.- I find the scroll wheel to only be mildly useful, but that\'s just my based on my own needs and usage.','2014-01-11 02:00:00',5,11,260),(721,'  If Captain Ahab had used this keyboard when hunting Moby Dick, he would have easily killed the beast. This thing blows my old Razer keyboard out of the water in every single category. It appears very well made, with no visible scratches or dents in it. Although this is more of a personal preference, the keys feel perfect to me. The rgb lights are excellent and are much more vibrant than what I\'ve seen on other keyboards. The software for this keyboard is easy to install and use. I am 90% convinced that God Himself created this keyboard.HOWEVERI had more trouble with this packaging than I did with my last girlfriend. Heck, when the package arrived, I wasn\'t sure if it was even a keyboard. The box could have fit a small child inside of it, and looked like it had been attacked by a rabid raccoon. The tape was the real shiner, though. Trying to tear this tape open is like trying to split an atom.Great keyboard though!','2014-02-18 06:00:00',3,5,260),(722,'  I bought the 200$ Apex Pro from SteelSeries to replace my Logitech G910 and liked it so much I wanted to use it at work (I\'m that guy at the office who uses a gaming keyboard for work, but I\'m a programmer so people expect it). I didn\'t want to move it around and couldn\'t justify buying two, so I got this as a middle ground because it\'s basically a cheaper version of that one, the only difference between the Apex 5 and Pro is that the 5 uses a plastic frame, doesn\'t have an extra USB outlet and it doesn\'t have the Apex Pro mechanical switches that let you control the actuation point of each individual key.However, Regardless of the more expansive features of the Apex Pro, I discovered that I liked typing on the Apex 5 more, even if it is cheaper. The clicky feeling of the mechanical like switches are simply too satisfying for their own good and I honestly miss them when using the other keyboard that\'s twice the price for typing.Now, one thing I\'ll concede on is I haven\'t tried them for gaming, and I really like the Apex Pro for gaming because I can make certain keys more sensitive - this one doesn\'t have that feature - but I can\'t imagine it would be bad if that\'s what you\'re looking for. It\'s also a lot louder than the Apex Pro, but when I brought that up with one of my co-workers who sits next to me, they said they didn\'t even notice it.Steel Series makes excellent products in general, so I highly recommend you give this keyboard a shot. Don\'t let the fact that it\'s not technically \"mechanical\" bother you, it still feels amazing.','2021-12-19 23:16:51',4,19,260),(723,'  The material of this keyboard is simply top-notch. Video reviews you\'ve seen about this keyboard are accurate: it\'s very high quality for a very low price (compared to others on the market). The keys are made of a smooth, matte plastic with a non-slip surface. The keys are satisfyingly clicky and soft (Blue hybrid keys).However, my largest gripe with his keyboard is the actuation pressure. Simply tapping a key with your finger can cause it to be pressed, they\'re hair-trigger keys. Very, very little pressure is required, and the key input is registered BEFORE the key is pressed completely down (about halfway). This isn\'t something I like whatsoever, however, it\'s not a deal breaker. I still recommend this keyboard, but this \"issue\' is something to be aware of.','2021-12-19 23:16:52',5,15,260),(724,'  I had my eye on the Apex 7 Pro for a while, but as someone who isn\'t a PC gamer, I couldn\'t justify the purchase. My only real reason for wanting it was I thought it looked cool and just wanted it bad. So it kind just sat in my wishlist. Then I happened across this the Apex 5, and I was shocked at the price and the fact it had almost every feature that made me like the Apex 7.I saw people complain about the blue switches and that they are loud, which they are, but I LOVE the clicky noises, very satisfying. It doesn\'t have USB passthrough, but that is all right, not a significant loss. I recommend 100% recommend this keyboard for anyone who wants premium without the price tag.','2021-12-19 23:16:53',5,12,260),(725,'            Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n        \n\n\n   Let me just start off by saying that I am not a gamer, so I can\'t really provide the most in-depth review of it. But, so far, this has ranked in the top three keyboards I\'ve owned for value, if not the best. The hybrid blue switches are pure tactility and a pleasure to type on, albeit slightly less resistant than a normal full mechanical MX blue. The ABS keycaps have a premium matte black finish, making it feel even better, and the wristrest is perfect. Not the mushy kind like razer\'s, actually a bit hard, but that is all accounted for by the rubber on top, which provides lots of support while typing. the video above is comparing this keyboard against an apple magic keyboard. Which is better is your opinion, but I think the Apex wins. At a slightly beefy price of $99.99, I expected to be blown awayy, and, suffice to say, I wasn\'t disappointed.','2021-12-19 23:16:54',5,20,260),(726,'  The Apex 5 Hybrid keyboard is an amazing choice for those looking to put together a decent gaming setup or a much needed needed upgrade from a cheaper membrane keyboard. While this is NOT a mechanical keyboard, the tactile feel and responsiveness of the keys is incredible and will definitely give you that mechanical feel without shelling out the extra $50-$100 or more to get an actual mechanical keyboard.The Apex 5 also has very nice rgb lighting, with multiple presets and tons of options to make your keyboard glow in any way you please (or not glow at all, if that\'s your thing). There\'s also a multimedia button, a volume wheel and a tiny LCD display that can display images, gifs and can even be used to monitor the status of your hardware in real time, plus much more.Finally,  this keyboard is a dream to type and game with. All of the keys are on an angle, which feels so natural to rests your fingers on. It also comes with a pretty sturdy set of feet to raise the keyboard, and it feels wonderful in combination with the detachable wristbar. Even as someone who is less experienced with pc gaming I have no issue reaching any of the keys without comfort while playing games (That\'s a pretty big deal for me, since on most average keyboards the ctrl button is just a bit too far away and is uncomfortable to press, especially in first person games where crouch is assigned to it)Overall, the Apex 5 is a great keyboard and delivers on everything it promises. At it\'s current price there really isn\'t much other keyboards that can compete with this one. If you\'re looking to do some serious gaming and want a good all around keyboard that will be up to the task, the Apex 5 has you covered.','2021-12-19 23:16:55',3,15,260),(727,'  I really like the look of this keyboard AND the way it feels when typing. I had a gaming keyboard with Cherry Red MX switches and it was great for gaming, but terrible for typing. I\'d always ended up with tons of typos because of the key sensitivity.This keyboard is a great for both gaming and typing. It\'s a little loud and clicky, which doesn\'t really bother me. The LCD lights are extremely bright and attractive.My biggest gripe with the keyboard is that the built in OLED screen is almost completely useless. It\'s so hidden behind the tall 10-key keys that I went a full three days of owning it, before I noticed that it was there. You need to really lean forward over your keyboard to see it. This is not a big deal because I didn\'t buy it for that tiny screen. If an on keyboard OLED screen important to you, buy a different keyboard.I definitely recommend this keyboard to anyone who games, but also wants to type things without constant typos.','2021-12-18 19:29:38',3,1,260),(728,'  I love SteelSeries. I have their Artis Pro Headset and wanted to pair together with the keyboard. As it currently stands the spacing between the keys or the way the keys face is planed seems to through me off. It doesnt feel natural for me to use this keyboard, which is really disappointing. I\'m going to give it another week to see if I can adapt to this but I had just ordered two new keyboards and the first one, offbrand, felt much easier to use. Just a heads up for fellow gamers, maybe test this one out before you commit to it. Overall quality, etc is there but the ergonomics of the keyboard seem to off put me','2021-12-19 23:16:57',4,10,260),(729,'  There are many good things about this keyboard but overall, I don\'t recommend this keyboard and I will explain why.First some positive points:+Appearance; This keyboard simply looks amazing. With light on or off it just looks so minimal and beautiful. The RBG colors are probably one of the best I have ever seen.+Media keys: they volume wheel and the pause/play button are really helpful.+The wrist rest: This is my favorite thing about this keyboard.  Some Youtube reviewers say it feels cheap but I just love it. It could be slightly wider to support larger hands but it’s just great. So easy to clean and not too rough and not to soft like razer wrist rests.+Cable routing options: it really helps to keep your cable out of the way and keep you desk organized.+Build quality: The keyboard feels solid and really sturdy on your desk. It also doesn’t move or slip. The wrist rest doesn’t move either.+The font/legends: they are standard and aren’t weird looking.+Steel series engine is really amazing. So easy to use and really helpful+You can change RGB effects and macro functions without having to use the software which is really convenient.Now, let’s take a look at some negatives:-the keycaps: The keycaps feel really really cheap. Even after only 3 weeks of use, I feel the surface of the keys that I use feel washed out and a bit smoother than the first day. They also have a quality to them that makes them extra noisy and rattly.-the switches: I have so many problems with the switches. First of all, why blue switches? Almost no gamer prefers blue switches for gaming and this keyboard is advertised and designed for gamers. So this is the first really weird choice. Honestly, I feel they decided to use blue switches because they are targeting younger generation who are probably buying a mechanical keyboard for the first time so they wanted to give them something that feels and sounds a lot different than a membrane or a laptop keyboard but I simply hate these switches. They are loud in the most annoying way. I have heard other blue switches and some of the have a sophisticated quality to them but these simply sound horrible.Anther extremely negative aspect of this keyboard is that it uses “Hybrid” switches. (you can see on youtube what they are) This is bad because of two reasons. First of all, with the same price or even cheaper, you can get fully mechanical keyboards that feel and sound 100 times better. Also, if one of your switches breaks (like mine did) there is no way you can find a replacement for them. I contacted Steelseries and they simply said they don’t sell the switches separately. One of the main reasons why people buy mechanical keyboards is to be able to replace dead or broken switches which is impossible with Apex 5. I ended up asking for a replacement, but the second keyboard was defective as well (the space bar got stuck in place). Luckily, amazon had my back and refunded almost all my money. One last problem I have with the switches is that they don’t feel reliable. Although they are blue (clicky and tactile), the switches sometimes actuate before the click which automatically cancels the whole point of the keyboard being tactile. :DThe switches are produced by a Chinese company called TTC. I have never heard their name so it’s easy to put the blame on them but it is a Steel series product after all.-The OLED: It looks cool but it’s just useless. It does all the thing they claim is does but I’m not the kind of person to put the time to get used to it. I simply prefer 3 simple LED light for Caps, numlock and scroll lock.What annoys me the most about this keyboard in general is that it doesn’t hold up to older Steelseries products quality. To me, it is clear that Steel series is targeting the less experienced consumers and not professional gamers anymore. I mean, there is no way a pro gamer puts up with this quality. It is just unacceptable from Steel Sereis. I have a Steel series mouse and I’ll probably buy another Steel series mouse after this one. But I’m sure I won’t buy their keyboards at least for a long time.All in all, this is simply a bad keyboard for this price. Yes, it has many cool features but there are so many better keyboards that you can find so almost half the price. Honestly, after some research on the internet, I am convinced that gaming brand keyboards are not worth it because they are almost always over-priced.','2021-12-19 23:16:58',5,10,264),(730,'  I think a big issue with what people say about hybrid-mechanical keyboards is that people who are already used to mechanical keyboards don\'t really want to move away from the mechanical feature anyway, so of course you\'ll hear a lot of bad things about hybrid-mechanical setups. In this case, I\'ve only been incredible happy with this keyboard.The RGB is great and is incredibly customizable, and has 5 onboard memory profiles. The keyboard is very well made, and I\'ve honestly been quite impressed with it. The typing experience is great too. There is a point where you feel a gentle \'click\' on your fingers, and that click is very well timed to when the keyboard actually registers a button press. So, even though this keyboard isn\'t mechanical, it still gives you that fast-clicky feeling if that\'s what you\'re into. I would, however say, that the only reason to get a hybrid-mechanical keyboard is price.I think if you are really trying to get a deal, the apex pro 5 is a great option. I got it for about $70, compared to other keyboards at about $130 with similar functionality. If you\'re already considering that $100-150 price range, then go full mechanical. You\'ll probably be getting a little more in terms of functionality and you\'ll also be getting the full mechanical experience. Overall I\'m very happy with this keyboard.','2021-12-19 23:16:59',4,16,264),(731,'            Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n        \n\n\n   EDIT:I bought a GK500 keyboard to have everything syncing but I guess I can only leave one reviewso here\'s a low down of the keyboard which im more impressed withKeyboard Pros:+ excellent blue type of switches, very responsive and tactile, feels great to type on+ great build quality, I especially like the magnetically attached wrist-rest. powerful magnets and can keep them apart too, also no more broken connector tabs (you know what im talking about with those old style palm rests)+ there are so many lighting effects to choose from, you can truly customize it and it syncs well with the mouse although mouse has limited number of light effects so when you sync, there\'s less to choose from+ aluminum face plate, good lighting, good double shot keys+ NKRO, I type pretty fast and sometimes I game even faster and so far I haven\'t noticed any ghosting (I key about avg of 80wpm correctly, up to 120 if some typos are allowed on this)Keyboard minuses:- the key axials arent the tightest and keys can feel a tiny bit wobbly but it hasn\'t really impacted the accuracy or speed of my typing- looks like the software still needs some improvements but I think it is getting there- too bad some of the fancier lighting effects like fireworks or radial don\'t work when synced with mouse-------------------------------------Gaming Mouse Low down:basically a lightweight, ambidextrous mouse that is fast and sensitive for me to get back into gamingI bought it with the GK500 keyboard so I could sync up the lighting effects on my deskfirst thing I noticed is that it comes out kind of reversed out of the box, the left and right mouse buttons are fine, just the forward and backwards browser buttons are on the right side of the mouse instead of the left.so I just needed to download the G-Tools to get it all remappedeasy enough that the G-Tools software also noticed there is a new firmware for the mouse and updated it toothere is one more annoyance though, the g-tools software installed and showed up in French by default but the top right corner has the language selection so it was easy enough to get it into English without me understanding much FrenchThe lighting effects can sync with the keyboard but there is only like 4 types of syncing it can do due to the lack of variation the mouse\'s light effects hasoverall though, it isn\'t easy to find a basic yet high performance ambidextrous mouse these days for gamingand with my son being left handed, this is something he will also be using so I\'m glad it is all working out, with the software and allhe\'s now a 6 years old enjoying watching the light sync up and changing colors with the keyboard on the desk','2020-09-10 03:00:00',5,20,264),(732,'  When the package arrived the box had previously been opened. upon inspection, everything seemed to in working condition and no wear marks. keyboard functions as it is intended to. very clicky.

RGB light is fantastic. You can choose from 4 preset modules or to control by the AOC G-tool app. The thing I loved the most is the wrist rest. It has magnets that snaps into place. Also leather material is really soft and comfortable and I can rest my wrist comfortably. USB Pass-through 2.0 Type-A is useful too. It goes well with the other mouse AGM700 I bought as a set. It only needs to run 1 cable to the PC.This design of the mouse definitely paired with the look of my AOC screen and keyboard.  The color scheme and the tone are very similar to the AGK700 AGON keyboard. I really like the material of the left and right mouse buttons. Some sort of metal-like texture. Adjustable DPI is really convenient too. The only thing I would nic-pick is the adjustable weight. It’s hard to get the weight out from the slot. Other than that, it is a great looking mouse!','2021-12-19 23:16:54',3,16,264),(734,'  Loved that the macros was stored on the on board memory without any issues. Once the macros is on the onboard memory, the macros stored on this mouse can be run on any other computer without having to install any software. It even plays back the time delay recorded between key presses if that feature is desired.Surprisingly a lot of other mice can\'t do this; even ones that cost 3 to 4 times as much. Their on board memory is limited to one/two key assignments per mouse button and require software installation for macros use. Then amongst the mice that don\'t require software installation to playback macros, some of them lose the recorded delays between key presses when playing back the macros if no software is installed.In my search for this mouse, I tried mice from: Logitech, Roccat, Corsair and SteelSeries.','2019-11-18 14:15:00',5,15,264),(735,'  Not happy to have paid for a \"NEW\" keyboard and then recieve an open box return with the shipping lable from the previous reciepent still on the box.

Both my boyfriend and my brother are gamers. My boyfriend has been a gamer for years and is currently customizing his own battle station with RGB lights and all. Whereas, my younger brother just started getting into computer games.My boyfriend was using an HP keyboard for both work and games, but wanted to upgrade to a mechanical keyboard. He was looking at a few Razer keyboards, but it was too expensive. Considering the price, I thought the AGON set would be a great gift to complete his setup. My boyfriend was super ecstatic when I gave it to him. So far, he loves how it feels when he types and how fast it registers. When I tried it out myself, typing felt amazing. Now I understand why people love mechanical keyboards so much. My boyfriend uses the memory profiles the most because he’s constantly switching between games with his friends and the media keys because he plays a ton of music while he plays. It’s also pretty hefty so the keyboard doesn’t move around so much when he’s playing. The keyboard lights are super pretty when the lights are dimmed low. His only complaint is that there aren’t many light effects. The mouse is super fast compared to his old Logitech wireless mouse that he\'s had for some time. It also comes with these small weights at the bottom of the mouse that you can adjust based on your weight preferences, which I thought was a nifty feature. Overall, he’s super happy with his keyboard and mouse set.My little brother just started gaming last summer using some computer hand-me-downs from friends and family. I promised him that if he got good grades over the year, I\'d get him a new keyboard and he passed the school year with flying colors. He was so excited for his first gaming keyboard, when it arrived and he plugged it into his computer immediately. It\'s a really good size for him and it\'s lightweight enough for him to bring it with him when he goes over to his friend\'s house. He also likes how there\'s a wrist rest for when his hands get tired during online classes or when he\'s writing an essay for homework. He loves how the RGB lights light up his desk area and makes it easier for him to see when he\'s typing.TL;DR: Both my boyfriend and my younger brother love their new gaming accessories!','2014-05-20 05:30:00',5,3,265),(741,'            Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n        \n\n\n   For some background, while I do use the keyboard for some gaming (mostly FPS) I am primarily a typist that transcribes hours upon hours of audio for work. I\'ve owned the original in blue switches, red LED for some time, but wanted an upgrade to quieter switches to hear audio better and get some nice rgb.It seems that both Cherry and Corsair have tried to cut corners in places that are less likely to be immediately noticed by customers. This will still very much yield a lesser quality, and more likely to fail over time product.-Compared to the original K70, the overall quality of this product is less. The first and most glaring thing I noticed are the stabilizers for larger keys (space, 0, shift, etc) are far looser/poorly fit on the mk2. The black retention pieces (see video) have SO much slop compared to the original. I can only really get any movement on the original if I really force it. This creates not just extra movement on the keys, but it also makes it noisey. Often times, this is part of what gives people that notorious spacebar rattle. As pieces wear over time this will only get worse. Especially for a transcriber, I have several special functions that rely on shift and combinations of shift with other keys. The extra slop is noticeable compared to the first version and I can hear it almost as loud as blue switches through headphones when transcribing audio. Already I have an awful amount of audible rattle on my backspace key, while my original is rock solid.-A second thing I\'ve noticed is how they\'ve relaxed the tolerances on the key caps and switch stems is. On the original version, it was very difficult to remove the key caps from the switches unless you had a wire puller. On the \"updated\" mk2, they pop off so easily and can be put back on with so little finger pressure, I almost didn\'t believe I had them on. This is not a good thing: it will make the caps more susceptible to wear that will create more slop, and overall just does not convey quality. If you\'ve ever had a spacebar that had a problem where overtime if you hit one side of the key and the other side would pop up and stay there, this is why: keycaps/stems with poor tolerances.-Third, the switches themselves have more play in them than the original k70. It created a noticeable amount more key wobble.Overall, after a year and hundreds upon hundreds of hard typing and key smashing when raging, my original k70 is still a higher quality product than the new mk2. The tighter tolerances on the original almost make it feel like a newer product than the mk2 I got in the mail literally today. The overall typing experience on the mk2 is just sloppier and it does not inspire confidence in the long run. Some upgrades are admittedly awesome. The clear switches really enhance the lighting, the on-board profile storage is fantastic. HOWEVER, looking at it in terms of the functionality this piece of hardware is required/designed to perform, (TYPING) they clearly decided to throw away some quality in favor of some pretty bells and whistles. If I had never experienced another high end keyboard, specifically the predecessor, I may have given this a higher rating, but in lieu of knowing what\'s being lost, I can\'t.At some level, it\'s almost insulting that they\'re trying to pass this off as an \"upgrade\" when they\'ve reduced the essential functions of their original to something of lesser quality.','2014-01-11 02:00:00',5,1,265),(742,'  Disclaimer: Ive used the Steel Series 6Gv2 (Cherry MX Black), as well as the Razer Black widow (Cherry MX Brown).For purposes of this review i am focusing on the performance, feel and build quality. (Spoiler: ITS FANTASTIC)Of all the keyboards i have used and typed on, this is by far the greatest thing my fingers have ever had the pleasure of experiencing besides *censored for family-friendly purposes*.Let me just say that if you enjoy linear switches, but are nervous about the sensitivity of the Cherry-Silver switches found on this board then fear not, for that was also my fear. The problem i had with cherry black was that sometimes i would press a key quickly just to find that i did not press hard enough and i would actually miss key presses that way. I got the black widow for the brown switches thinking that the tactile bump would help me know when the key was actuated. While it helped i could not help but feel that the tactile bump somehow slowed me down or got in the way of that smooth gliding typing feel.ENTER THE MX CHERRY SILVER.While i have never tried reds, i have heard that they are some of the most preferred switches for gaming. Having tried these silver switches i can now see why. (Reds are similar to silver switches, but with a deeper actuation point of 2.0mm compared to the Silver\'s 1.2mm actuation travel. The Reds total travel distance is also deeper at 4.0mm, Silver\'s total key travel is 3.4mm deep) When i go for a key, there is no worry about the key not actuating for the key effortlessly gives into the force of my finger. The switches are not so sensitive where the weight of my finger alone actuates them. It is just PERFECT. It truly is a hard thing to describe. For gaming i cannot imagine a better switch or board. And typists fear not for if you are sure footed in your typing skills then know that the linear switch is not your enemy when it comes to the Silver MX switches. I actually look forward to using this Keyboard every day. That is literally how much i enjoy this board. This is the first review i\'ve wrote on amazon in years. That is literally how much i enjoy typing on this board. I almost dont want to even stop typing now lol. The funny thing is i was going to get the k70 with cherry mx browns, but decided on the LIMITED EDITION WHITE VERSION because it includes the DOUBLE SHOT KEYCAPS. which was a big deal for me. I wanted the most durable keyboard i could get and i saw how on the regular k70 some people complained about breaking keycaps. (YOU CAN BUY THE DOUBLE SHOT KEYCAPS SEPARATELY FOR $50). I thought it was well worth the risk with Amazons generous return policy to try this one out. PLUS THAT WHITE KEYBOARD IS SEXY LOOKING AF.I typed this whole review out on the board and only made 1-2 typos.rgb lighting is self explanatory. its gorgeous. everything about this board is gorgeous.BOTTOM LINE OR TLDR:Avid typist or Gamer you will not regret splurging on this board. It is the best purchase i have ever made for a PC peripheral and it works well on MAC as well. The included wrist rest is also really nice. though it is rigid is has a soft touch texture and has eliminated elbow and wrist discomfort that i would normally get on my glass desk surface.ps. DID I MENTION HOW MUCH I LOVE THE VOLUME WHEEL? EVEN WORKS ON THE MAC!Edit(11/3/2021) This keyboard is still rocking without a single issue yet! I hope they continue producing it. It seems the newer designs are straying away from what worked so well on this edition. Many of these companies are attempting to produce their own gamer switches rather than rely on MX Cherry. MX Cherry has the best reputation for switch quality though for obvious reasons so keep that in mind when researching your next keyboard.','2014-02-18 06:00:00',5,11,265),(743,'  It worked exactly as advertised. However I must point out it struggles like all corsair products, if it is not connected to the PC and connected to any form of USB hub. To include monitor, external, or internal. Corsair products do horrible with hubs and should be connected only to the back USB slots of your PC. Even front side struggles unless it is a USB 3.0 --Don\'t ask me why. I have purchased over a dozen of their products over the years, and it is always the same issue. However just on a lark I decided to test it anyway. Sure enough it would give me yellow or red ! points in corsair link on reboot in any USB hub on my old and my new gaming pc. Monitor USB, Separate USB hub, didn\'t matter. So the issue persists.The product is great really no need for details other reviewers covered that. I just wanted to point out an issue that most have no idea is the cause of 99% of negative reviews. That for most people won\'t be an issue at all.If you think you can go razor and avoid this issue... you can\'t their keyboards have the same problem. Logitech keyboards however do not, at least the prodigy doesn\'t. I haven\'t used nearly as many of their products as corsair or razor so I can\'t speak for the majority.','2021-12-19 23:16:51',5,8,265),(744,'  If you go on r/MechanicalKeyboards you\'ll see corsair keyboards getting a lot of flack for being overpriced for for their quality but honestly I don\'t really see it, I think the quality is good enough, it\'s no tank but for something that will just sit on your desk the whole time it really doesn\'t need to be. The mk.2 seems to be sturdy enough, the top is a fairly thick piece of aluminum, about as thick as I would expect a keyboard faceplate to be at least, and the whole thing is fairly ridged overall. The bottom of made of plastic and I see people complain that it\'s too thin but if you\'re not using your keyboard to bludgeon your enemies then it should hold up just finr. My biggest gripe with this keyboard are the keycaps, they\'re light, thin and laser ablated so they\'re likely to wear over time. Corsair offers a doubleshot version of these same keycaps, but they\'re another $50 so if you\'re set on getting those then this starts to become a nearly $200 keyboard. That being said, I think that if quality had to be sacrificed somewhere to meet this price point then the keycaps are the most logical option as they\'re the only part of the keyboard you can easily modify yourself if you want and I really don\'t see them as a huge problem until they actually start to wear. This keyboard comes with another set of WASD and QERF keys with a textured surface that won\'t wear so if you mostly use those it\'s probably not a huge issue. I suppose only time will tell how bad these keys wear.I was looking for several things in a keyboard, I wanted an aluminum top plate, a minimal, clean look, RGB and I wanted it to be mechanical and this keyboard meets all those things.I really like the brushed aluminum, it doesn\'t take on finger prints, it looks really good and it adds some good heft so full points there. The switches protrude out of the faceplate so there is nowhere for dirt and dust to fall in to and get trapped, this makes it really easy to clean with one of those compressed air cans so if you like to keep things clean then that is a huge plus. This is a really good looking keyboard, it doesn\'t overdo it by trying to look all gamery and wouldn\'t look out of place in an office or anything (with the RGB off at least), though you can see the pictures for yourself so whether you like how it looks is really up to you.The RGB is fully customizable on a per key basis but if you want all the fancy effects then you always need to have the corsair iCUE software running in the background which I\'m not a huge fan of. You can save three RGB profiles onto the keyboards internal memory but the effects are a bit more limited if you chose to rely only on that. You can still set each key to any color you want and you can use some effects, but the effects can\'t be as elaborate as if you have the software running in the background. This isn\'t a huge problem for me because I don\'t really want much more than static back lighting anyway but its something you should be aware of. I guess each key can be readdressed to do whatever you want and you can make macros, but this particular model doesn\'t have any dedicated macro keys. These aren\'t really features that I\'ve needed to use and so I don\'t particularly care about them.I got the version with the cherry mx brown switches because up to now I\'ve been using a keyboard with blue clones and I wanted to try something different. I miss the clickyness of the blues but I like the feel of the browns well enough, I only wish that they were more tactile because the tactile bump isn\'t super prominent and isn\'t very sharp.  The browns are a lot less noisy that blues but they\'re still nowhere near silent. Most of the sound just comes from the keys bottoming out so it could be made just a little more silent with some o-rings but I don\'t like the feel of the o-rings as much. I considered returning this key board and getting the version with the blue switches for a little while but I\'ve grown to like the brown switches, but it\'s all subjective. A lot of hard core mech keyboard enthusiasts don\'t really like browns but I don\'t have much experience with other switches so I can\'t say too much about that.The dedicated media controls are nice to have I suppose, but I only ever find myself using the volume knob. The wrist rest is just solid plastic but it has a soft texture and is definitely a plus, I haven\'t used one up to now but I don\'t think I could go without one in the future as it makes typing so much more comfortable. The USB passthrough is a nice feature, I use it for my wireless mouse dongle so that it\'s closer and the connection is more reliable but I imagine that it would be really convenient for a wired mouse as well, there are some routing channels on the bottom of the keyboard for the wire to keep things tidy if you do use a wired mouse . I don\'t think the passthrough wouldn\'t be ideal for something that you would remove and insert frequently because it\'s on the back of the keyboard which makes it awkward to get to in my opinion. The USB cable is braided and really thick which gives it a pretty premium feel. It\'s also super long so you shouldn\'t have much trouble getting it to where you need it to go. It\'s pretty ridged so if you move the keyboard around a lot on your desk that might be a bit of a problem.This keyboard really needs to be packaged better, Amazon just ships it in the box that the keyboard comes in and there isn\'t any foam or anything in that box so the only thing between the top of the keyboard and the boxes that will inevitably be dropped or stacked on top of it during shipping is a piece of cardboard. Because of this, my keyboard came with some of the keys knocked out both times, I replaced my first one because I thought it came broken. The first one\'s volume wheel was really loose compared to the second one I received, I don\'t know if that was a manufacturing defect or from rough treatment during shipping but it would be nice if Amazon just shipped it in another box with some proper packing material.','2021-12-19 23:16:52',5,13,265),(745,'  I purchased the CORSAIR K70 RGB MK.2 SE Mechanical RAPIDFIRE and have been using it for over 3 months now. If you\'re questioning about getting this or not, not to get all Shia Labeouf on you but...JUST! DO! IT! Corsair\'s listing photos are an accurate representation of the actual product. Also, it\'s currently cheaper ($130 what a steal) than when I had bought it ($174). At first, I was hesitant because of the price, but in the end I bit the bullet and I\'m glad I did because I absolutely love everything about this keyboard.The white keys against a brushed aluminium frame is aesthetically pleasing. The special edition also looks great with custom keycaps. Also, the keys look as amazing as they feel. Like most mechanical keyboards, the keys feel and sound great to press. I\'ve been having a great time gaming with this keyboard because of its responsiveness and textured preset keycaps. At first, I was wary that the keys were white because they\'d get dirty easily, but that\'s actually not the case. Everything looks clean and new. Even the braided cord looks great.The RGB customization for Corsair is great. I love how easy it is to operate iCue. In addition, changing color profiles has been made easier with the addition of the first silver button on the left of the keyboard that looks like the silhouette of an orange-ish/yellow person. You can alternate between your saved RGB profiles by pressing that button. Next to that button is a little sun symbol which allows you to choose between 3 settings of lighting, which range between dim and bright. The music buttons above the number pad look great and I especially love the scroll wheel for volume, it\'s efficient and looks good.I actually do like the angled wrist rest. I didn\'t think I would be using it after reading about how others didn\'t like it in their review, but it\'s a lot more comfortable than I anticipated. While it doesn\'t feel like a pillow, I think it\'s great for gaming because of the elevation and the texture alleviates any kind of friction you\'d normally get leaning your wrist against the edge of your desk. I also appreciate the built-in USB port, it\'s great for anyone who doesn\'t have enough USB ports on their laptop/PC tower.I could go on and on about how much I love this keyboard, but all in all, it\'s a good looking keyboard that\'s efficient and definitely well-made with good quality materials. Worth it.','2021-12-19 23:16:53',1,10,265),(746,'  This is for the MK.2 SE. It\'s gorgeous. The (silver) aluminum surface partially reflects the RGB lighting underneath the key caps. The Corsair software (iCUE) allows for separate profiles that the user can switch between via a dedicated button on the keyboard.The Cherry MX Speed (silver) switches are nicer than the Cherry Silent (red/pink) switches I used previously (keyboard switches are, of course, personal preference).The PBT key caps are sturdy and well built. Additionally, it is nice to have an option to use textured WASD key caps, which come included. A key cap pull tool is also included.The media buttons and volume control work well. The volume dial is easy to rotate and very responsive. The back lighting for the media buttons are also RGB, so they can be set up to blend in or stand out.','2021-12-19 23:16:54',5,15,265),(747,'  I\'d like to issue a warning to all prospective buyers. Don\'t. Period. This keyboard is nothing but a marketing fiasco designed to make you think you are getting some sort of edge over the competition. I assure you, you are not.The marketing wants you to believe the extremely short actuation is a benefit, but it\'s nothing but a detriment. Keys on this keyboard activate like a hair trigger, even if slightly (and I mean SLIGHTLY) nudged. I can run my fingertips over it gently and it will create word spaghetti. This is insane, and all it does is cause you to take actions that you did not intend while playing.In addition, the Corsair iCUE software is joke. It takes up gigs of memory all to do what? Change the color? It makes zero sense. It\'s also excessively confusing and very very buggy. There is no reason a software like this should be so bloated.Stay away from this product, and probably Corsair all together. They are overpriced junk!','2021-12-19 23:16:55',1,8,265),(748,'  Been using the Corsair K70 for about a month now and here are my thoughts:1.  The quality of the keyboard is absolutely top notch.  The solid metal construction, the wrist rest, the packaging, the RGB lighting.  All amazing.  I could easily see this keyboard lasting me the rest of my life.2.  I am not an expert on mechanical keys and frankly it had been so long since I had used one I didn\'t really even care. I almost saved the money and just bought Corsair\'s regular keyboard (non mechanical).  However, after a month of using this I am glad I didn\'t.  It actually took me some time to get used to the mechanical switches but now that I am, I love them.  They make everything more enjoyable (typing and gaming) and certainly allow me to type faster.  There is no doubt about it, they are superior.3.  The roller in the upper right hand corner of this keyboard is main volume control, as you probably guessed.  Let me tell you:  its freakin awesome, just brilliant.  I use it constantly.  I don\'t think I can ever go back to having volume keys/ buttons.4.  This keyboard includes two additional sets of \"gaming\" keys.  Basically the A,S,D,Q,W and E keys but they are shaped differently and have a different texture so you can locate them more easily during gaming.  I am not using them but it is a nice touch by Corsair.  Someday I might throw them on just to try them.5.  Now the RGB: I have to say it is growing on me.  I did not buy this for the RGB and even now I still have it set on just a solid red glow, which is what its been on since I got it.  But I have also played Far Cry 5 and now the new Far Cry (New Dawn) with it and the native support in those two games is pretty awesome.  Particularly New Dawn.  The profile for that game is very nice and actually does add a level of interaction that you wouldn\'t expect.  I have only played New Dawn for a total of about an hour so far and have already seen this keyboard do a bunch of cool stuff in game.  For example, when you beat a mission, you get something like fireworks on the keyboard.  When it is night in the game, the keyboard RGB is more subdued.  The list goes on, the RBG lighting changes depending on what is happening in game and it really is cool, even to me.  I also have a Corsair Pro series water cooler and gaming mouse but the RBG lighting on those just isn\'t nearly as intricate as this keyboard.  I am now considering downloading some more profiles , or perhaps making one myself.Don\'t hesitate to buy this keyboard, you won\'t be disappointed with any aspect of it.  And certainly if you are an RGB fan, you are sure to love it.','2021-12-18 19:29:38',1,10,265),(749,'  It is a pretty solid keyboard quality wise. But i have been using it for a couple of days now and i plug my mouse to the keyboard and since both require so much electricity the performance of them suck. Mouse will literally be frozen for a second every two second and the keyboard would spam like 10 keys sometimes when you click one key.The iCue Corsair software is a complete menace, one of the worst software I have seen. It is not friendly user nor the interface leads you well, intuition and common sense can\'t be used to use this software. You have to guess and trouble shoot many times until you kind of get used to it but it\'s too complicated and wastes a lot of time. There is not logical buttons such as close tabs and stuff like that, you mostly have to click many areas of the screen to know where things are.  every piece of the screen of this software could either be clickable or not, but there isn\'t a concrete layout of tabs, mostly everything is thrown at users and the layers are all looking at you rather than one popping out per time. Very missleading.Incredibly hard-to-use software. Things are placed awkwardly. I also get a exclamation mark ontop of the keyboard icon sometimes but it provides no information about it so I don\'t know what is wrong.Impossible to know which tab, device or menu are you on since low-comon-sense Corsair made software terrible illogical. Basically you never get to know if something in its platform is clickable or not, where are you at since tabs or buttons don\'t show they are selected and everything is showned at the same time.Very difficult to understand. Keyboard did came with some minor damage which was not too visible on the side but that might be manufacture error','2021-12-19 23:16:57',4,10,268),(750,'  The keyboard arrived defective. After a few minutes of use I began having connection issues. It would disconnect and become unresponsive. The only solution was to disconnect the keyboard, wait a few minutes, then re-plug the keyboard. I noticed it would only work if I plugged in the lighting usb cable first, not the actual connection usb. I tried doing a soft reset, updating the keyboard software, updating my drivers, and even contacting Corsair support. Their support representatives were impatient, insisting they forward me to a customer support agent instead, who would later need to forward me BACK to the initial tech support agent (who was the only rep that could \"assist me with the issue\"). Additionally, the tech rep insisted I call Amazon if I had any persistent issues so they could forward me back to Corsair (Instead of just giving me a call back number).After creating an account with corsair support, having to provide non-relevant information (my address & phone number), i was Finally able to put in my support request via a ticket system. Afterwards the tech rep forwarded me instructions to hard reset the keyboard. Which was simply pressing the reset button under the keyboard and re-installing the keyboard software. Why not just tell me that over the phone instead of wasting my time and making me create an account (which funny enough had a low-key option to request for Corsair promotional emails - SPAM).The hard reset did NOT work, and I called amazon (as instructed by Corsair) to be forwarded back to Corsair Tech Support. Corsair proceeded to inform me they could not help me via phone (why not tell me that in the first place?). I proceeded to make progress to file my warranty claim. Their process is redundant, asking for both the invoice and receipt (asking for you to take a photo and forward it to them). They then ask you pull out your phone and take picture of the packaging in order to send them the serial number... why not just type the SN on a form via the website?All in all, the customer service was terrible, time consuming, and a waste of time. Save yourself the time if you encounter this issue, return it via Amazon (Hassle Free) and get your money back.','2021-12-19 23:16:58',5,13,268),(751,'  What I like:- It\'s mechanical, so it doesn\'t have ghosting!  Great for games.- The lights for the keys are bright.- Inexpensive.What I don\'t like:- The \"clickiness\" is a little loud, but I knew what I was getting into with a mechanical keyboard.  I think I just need to get used to it.- The right shift key sometimes gets slightly stuck when pressing it down.  I\'m a lefty and so I use the arrow keys with the shift key a lot when I am playing games.  That\'s when it usually happens, as opposed to normal typing.- The lock key indicators, i.e. caps lock, scroll lock, num lock, are REALLY dim and directional (and not towards where I sit).  I have to actually put my face over the keyboard to see whether they are on or not.  I think this is the biggest shortcoming of this keyboard, considering that keyboards have been around with brighter lights for these keys since the 80s?  Not to mention, there are unlit symbols rather than text indicating what each is for.  I have to test out a lock key to see which one will light up, since I cannot tell which is which just by looking at them.Overall: Good keyboard for the price.  Just wish those lock indicators were brighter and clearer to understand!','2021-12-19 23:16:59',1,16,268),(752,'  I\'ve always wanted a mechanical keyboard. The clickity-clack sound has always been so satisfying to me, and I hadn\'t had that since I finally gave up my XT PC over 30 years ago.This keyboard definitely scratches that itch.But this keyboard does more than that.Ignoring additional keys was a problem with my last \"gaming\" keyboard (SteelSeries Apex 100) where I\'d be trying to use the WASD keys and press other keybinds at the same time as moving.Do not have that problem anymore. This keyboard hasn\'t ghosted or ignored a single keypress once.The only thing I *wish* was available for this keyboard was a software engine like SteelSeries has where you can easily re-bind keys on your keyboard.For example I like to have the Num Lock and Keypad Enter keys disabled while I play World of Warcraft because I accidentally bump them during PvP and that messes up my ability to use my keypad keybinds.The workaround I found was using Microsoft PowerToys and that allowed me to disable the keys, but it did so for all applications across my computer.','2020-09-10 03:00:00',5,1,268),(753,'  This keyboard is very solidly made with great tactile feel of the keys -- I love it!  It\'s also nice that they include a hand rest (which is detachable, if you don\'t want it).  I specifically needed a longer USB cable to connect to my computer, and this Phillips Momentum gaming keyboard has a 6 foot cable, which is hard to find (most are 5ft).  For $40 this is a great value, hard to beat!UPDATE 9-12-21: I don\'t use this keyboard for gaming, just personal / business use -- so I am NOT pounding on it, just gentle typing.  Well the \"u\" key is typing double sometimes, or sometimes it doesn\'t work.

This is actually the first of 8 different haphazard LED settings, which you can access by hitting FN+1 through 8. They do not have any apparent rhyme or reason to them, so we will ignore them. If you wish to record custom LEDs, you want to use FN+9 and FN+0, which are blank on first blush. Only then do the instructions to hit FN+END to start/stop recording actually work. You will notice it working by the 3 lights next to your arrow keys flashing blue during the record phase.FN+ESC will delete your custom LEDs and reset the keyboard entirely.FULL ANTI-GHOSTING===The instructions are further confusing here, as they have FN+PRTSC labeled as \"6 keys anti-conflicting\" - and while this is actually true, this does not give you FULL anti-ghosting. In order to access that, you must hit FN+SCRLK.Further note that FN+ESC will reset your anti-ghosting back to 6.MISC===Beyond those functions, FN+DEL, FN+HOME, FN+PGUP, and FN+PGDN will activate additional LED settings.FN+LEFT and FN+RIGHT arrow keys will slow down / speed up the rate at which the lights activate.FN+DOWN and FN+UP arrow keys will adjust the brightness.','2014-05-20 05:30:00',3,8,273),(762,'            Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n        \n\n\n   This thing is so well made.

These switches have a click to them, but the tactile response and sound are lacking.  The keys have a squishy, almost membranous feel to them, despite clearly having mechanical switches.  I had hoped this would feel similar to another knock-off no-name brand keyboard I had purchased in the past, but I simply could not get over the spongy feel of these keys.  It may be perfectly fine for most applications, but if you have the means to purchase a more expensive keyboard with genuine Cherry switches (and you can tell the difference), then you\'ll be better off with another keyboard.Note:  As others have mentioned, more combinations than just Fn+Ins trigger the various LED patterns.  It appears that the buttons Ins, Home, PgUp, PgDn all have 3 different patterns. Fn+arrow keys control the brightness and the cycle speed for lighting effects.  Good variety of animations overall and it is nice to see a keyboard with built in features that does not require additional bloatware to be installed.','2014-02-18 06:00:00',1,17,273),(764,'  I bought this keyboard as a replacement for a different brand that my son had spilt coffe in. I was expecting much, given the price, but the feel is good, the board has enough weight to stay in place and the keys have a good feel and travel. It\'s a full size keyboard with numeric keypad. It doesn\'t really have dedicated media keys (although you can use some chords to get them), but that doesn\'t matter to me as I never used them anyway. One interesting feature is that the switches are mounted in the top plate of the keyboard, so there\'s nothing around the keycaps to trap crumbs and detritus, it\'s easy to use compressed air to blow out dirt around the keys and keep the board clean. It also has braided nylon insulation on the cord, so that should hold up better than the standard PVC insulation you normally see. I\'m probably going to buy a second one as a spare.','2021-12-19 23:16:51',5,9,273),(765,'  This keyboard is just awful. All of the LEDs are some random brightness. Most of them are too dim, very few are bright. It\'s as if some of the LEDs are defective and dim. The letters and numbers are in some weird font with a black vertical line down the center of them. For what purpose? To make them hard to decipher? Why did they even bother making this trash?','2021-12-19 23:16:52',5,4,273),(766,'  This keyboard is AWESOME! Plug and play, easy setup.

Comes with a key cap puller.Overall, this is a great value for the price.','2021-12-19 23:16:54',5,4,273),(768,'  I was looking for a clackety keyboard, and this was the best deal I could find.  The lights behind the keys aren\'t important to me -- in fact, they\'re somewhat distracting if you aren\'t used to it -- but another reviewer gave some good tips on how to customize the lighting.  Hitting FUNCTION + (INS or HOME or PGUP or PGDN or END or DEL) changes the light pattern; FUNCTION + UP/DOWN changes the brightness (or turns the LEDs off), and FUNCTION + LEFT/RIGHT changes the speed of the LED motion.I\'ve been using this to type quite a bit for the last six months and haven\'t had any problems.

This keyboard was what I was looking for along with my budget. The design and features were great. Very sturdy and responsive. Most of the keyboards that I was looking for didn\'t have a 10 key or if it did it was super bulky for some reason. It does have a clicky noise to it but I\'m sure all mechanical keyboards are like that. One of my favorite things is the RGB light, probably because I never had backlights before.  Installation was literally plugged/play and detected by Windows 10 PC.','2021-12-19 23:16:57',5,8,274),(771,'  I had a basic Dell usb multimedia keyboard with two usb passthru ports, but I didn\'t like the typing experience on the low profile keys.What I did want was a full size keyboard with larger (perhaps mechanical) keys, a usb connected, backlit, with a usb passthru port(s) to connect the receiver for my mouse.  I didn\'t want a bluetooth keyboard because I run two computers through my monitor\'s built in KVM switch and the connection would be undependable or delayed.  As a casual gamer, I was also interested in what features might be helpful there.While shopping, I quickly realized that the keyboards that met my criteria were mostly all $100-$250 gaming keyboards and I wasn\'t going to spend that.  Besides, most of them were on the bleeding edge with buggy features or required talking to the cloud to use, ugh.  None of them seemed like a good value to me, even Logitech of which I am a general fan.By chance, I ran across this Lenovo Legion K500.  I must tell you that I am a former IBM product designer and have a soft spot for the ex-IBM brand.  And we will never forget those perfect IBM keyboards of old.  So the potential and aesthetics of this product immediately caught my eye - clean, high tech, understated elegance with superior ergonomics.  It was usb connected and offered backlighting (even in custom colors).  It also included multimedia keys.  But no usb port - oh well.  Last but not least, it was a full sized keyboard with mechanical keys that would deliver the superior typing experience.  All at about $65.  So I gave up a usb passthru port to save $100+.I have to tell you, it has fully met and exceeded expectations., even the software makes sense and works great.  Although it\'s all plastic, it\'s a quality build that looks and feels much more expensive.  It\'s a beautiful addition to my desktop.  I\'ve fallen in love with it.

The backlight illuminates only the top characters on keys with two. For example, the entire top number row only illuminates the symbols ~ ! @  ...  ) _ +, but the ` 1 2  ...  9 0 - = characters remain dark (see photo). Likewise, it\'s easy to see < > in dim room light, but almost impossible to see the comma and period characters. The software utility can\'t turn on the lower characters\' backgrounds, and the contrast (gray on black) is very poor when all backlighting is disabled. But this may be the best choice in a well-lit room.2. Although the product description claims \"backlight: 16.8 million colors RGB per Key, programmable (need using Legion accessory software)\", these colors are \"per key\" only when by selecting the moving pattern background options (and the colors may be rainbow hues, but definitely not under your control). If you choose to assign a static background, then all keys are assigned the same color. Although the software tool allows you to \"Customize\" by selecting regions on a keyboard layout, each region is matched to a single selected color, or the backlight is turned off.3. The keyboard utility is all about the backlighting. There are no options to lock the Num Lock or Scroll Lock, or disable the CapsLock (I assigned Mute Audio as the least likely to cause problems).','2020-09-10 03:00:00',5,1,274),(774,'  Feels very well made, it\'s beefy and not light at all. The software is great. Probably the best keyboard I\'ve ever owned.

I will say this, I like the quality, weight and feel of the keyboard. It has the ability to connect with a bluetooth connection, or with the included dongle. Great! With the cool LED lighting that comes along with it I thought this would be a perfect solution to having two PCs, one for work, one for gaming. I could easily use the wireless peripherals with both machines and not have to deal with a ton of wires.Can you imagine then my disappointment when I discovered that this expensive keyboard is lacking in the ability to simply program the keys to light up as a single color without running their software in the background? Well, it\'s a pretty big disappointment. I am using this keyboard to connect to multiple PCs and it just doesn\'t work well for that purpose because my work PC can\'t control the keyboard lighting!WHY?!?! This seems like such a simple feature to have in the keyboard.UPDATE!!: Ok, so I am amending my initial review of this keyboard to 4 stars. Why? Well, I discovered that this keyboard actually does have some tricks up it\'s sleeve.

I purchased mine in Feb 2021 and was thinking \'best keyboard ever\' and by April was dealing with double, ttriple keystrokes.  I am purposely leaving the bad strokes in the review to let you know how many times it will happen in the course of a day.  The keyboard \'supposedly\' is dirty and I have even removed every single button twice, soaked them in soapppp and water and still have trouble with thhe multiple strokes.  This does not happen with $40 keyboards that I have owned for years annd I would expect something bettter from a $230 keyboard.SSecond issue is battery life.  With a full charge and all the lighting effects on, you are probably receiving maybe two days life before it stops, meaning you have to charge again.  Now my charge last a day.  I turned off the lighting effects which can get me maybe Day 3.  Eventually you will leave it connected 24/7 so losing the feature of havving a \'wireless keyboard\'.Again, I repeat the double and triple strokes you are seeing in this review happened naturally and in the regular course of writing this review.The five star reviews you see are from new owners(I myself would have given this five stars the first two months).  Once you use a mechanical keyboard, it is very difficult to go back, so I will try other mechanical','2021-12-19 23:16:58',5,6,280),(793,'  I have a Razer black widow elite and I love it but the super thick cable coming from the board made it hard to move around my desk when I needed to do schoolwork, so I figured “I love everything about this keyboard except the wire... why not just get the wireless version?” I was wrong. Or rather, Razer was wrong. These two keyboards share a basic set of aesthetics and that’s it. The V3 Pro feels like a $50 keyboard in the hands. Tons of rattle during regular use and the yellow switches have an extremely mushy feel. The letters/numbers on the keys are extra large for some reason? And that gives it this extremely cheap, dollar store toy feel. Plus the battery, good lord. The thing will barely run for 8 hours with rgb on (which is a pretty big reason to go with this “gamer” keyboard over similar wireless mechanical competitors) so unless you plug it in after every time you use it, you may find yourself without a keyboard when you need one. Speaking of the rgb, it’s atrocious. Not nearly as good or as smooth as the wired Blackwidow Elite counterpart. The v3 Pro has choppy lighting effects and stutters frequently even with the preset effects, not to mention the custom effects with the synapse software. I took a chance and ignored literally every YouTube video and ounce of research I did about this specific keyboard and I found out firsthand what an incredible disappointment this product is. This all may sound harsh, but this thing costs $230 - for a keyboard. Like, the only thing it does better than my $100 version is “no wires” but it does literally every other thing worse. The premium just isn’t worth it. If you’re going to charge that much for something, at least put a little effort into making it look/feel as good as its “lower tier” models. Do better, Razer. This is a scam.','2021-12-19 23:16:59',2,3,280),(794,'  Many of these reviews are not for the Razer BlackWidow V3 Pro. This new version 3 is absolutely wireless as a full-size, RGB lit, wireless keyboard. That\'s right- absolutely wireless! I type very, very fast and absolutely zero lag. I\'ll be curious on the prolonged battery life, but charging is fast. It\'s essentially a flawless replica of their main flagship keyboard. For me at least, my desk feels cluttered when thick cables are running all across it. This just uses a simple USB flush receiver for the signal. I haven\'t tried Bluetooth- and likely will never utilize that function.Since most products these days are USB-C, I keep a plugged cable readily tucked away which can easily charge my tablet, headphones, and now my keyboard! I now need a mouse that does the same.The Green tactical mechanical keys are great. No complaints, and miss it when I\'m using my laptop. This has the multimedia plugs which I use constantly. Mostly the round mute button that lights when volume is off. I never have to think about it on/off, and can easily turn the dial to my preferred volume.Hmm CONS: I would have loved some additional RGB, like the lighted wrist-pads of their other keyboards. Or how about accessories like a wrist-pad that has a built-in battery? Imagine extending the power by a month+. I\'m surprised they included no power adapter for outlet charging, so you must use a slow PC USB port. I\'m still not fully sold on Synapse.','2020-09-10 03:00:00',5,2,280),(795,'  Edit: Dropped a star since it still keeps dropping connection, just not as often.  This keyboard is less than 4 feet from the receiver with clear line of sight.So I got out of the Razer bandwagon a while back but in my research for a set of wireless devices for my new setup, the best I could find for each class of peripheral brought me back to Razer.First the good.- The keyboard feels good to type with.  Yellow switches are essentially MX Reds, and I gotta say, I was browns for life, but these switches are so smooth that I don\'t miss the bump.  I still might install some rubber grommets under the keys to soften the bottoming out sound, but it\'s actually not a hearty thunk that I don\'t feel like I need to.- Performs great, with surprising life.  Responsiveness is astoundingly fast, and an hour in Aim Hero and I can say that this keyboard holds up amazingly for a wireless device.  I\'ve been a staunch hater of wireless devices for a long time due to latency, batteries, performance, the list goes on.  But the BlackWidow V3 holds up in any game I\'ve thrown at it (MMO, FPS, ARPG).  They keyboard has lasted me about 18 hours of usage before I felt the need to recharge the thing with the lights set to static and 50% brightness.- Customization.  The software is a double edge sword (I\'ll get to that in a second), but you can change just about anything you\'d want to change for a keyboard.  Remap every possible button?  Sure!  Manage sleep, power saving, lighting, etc?  Sure!  That\'s... about it.The bad.- Can\'t assign RGP configuration to onboard memory.  Close the software, it goes right back to rainbow mode.  This is neigh unforgivable considering how every other gaming company is doing this, and Razer doesn\'t just to force you to use their ridiculous software.- Razer Software is ... man that\'s a mixed bag.  Razer Central is essentially their Launcher for Synapse and Codex but Synapse and Codex are always running.  I think the only welcoming part of Central is that I have one taskbar icon vs two.  Razer Codex is... I hate the thing but I\'m not gonna deep dive into how useful it is or isn\'t.  It was quickly uninstalled.  It has what could be great features but they just don\'t pull their weight enough to worth having the thing installed.  Which brings us to Synapse.  You need this to keep your color profiles for your keyboard, unless you want disco mode 24/7.  This is absolutely a prime example of how Razer prioritizes flair over function.  Managing your devices is almost perfect, but it can\'t do firmware updates which is a terrible shame which means you need to manually check regularly for updates (and you\'ll need them), and the fact that they gate features behind this software at all times is just awful.  But for the amount of resources it uses, I\'ll suffer it\'s existence.- Speaking of firmware, that the software this device needs doesn\'t manage like it should, this device will blow chunks out of the box.  Plugged it in and it just wouldn\'t stay connected, it was a miserable failure of engineering and I wanted to throw the thing out the window.  Out of the box it uses like, firmware 1.00.  IIRC the latest was like, 2.0?.  Once I managed to get to the support site to download the firmware updater, it stayed connected like a charm.  If you take anything from this review it\'s this.  UPDATE THE FIRMWARE AS SOON AS YOU CAN.The Forgivable- The one thing you can\'t manage is polling rate.  I would love to be able to use a lower polling rate for the keyboard when I\'m working or doing anything other than gaming to save battery life.  I won\'t ding the product for this, but would have been a nice option.- Like any RGB wireless device, the higher you set the brightness, the more the battery life is neutered.  This is an obvious given for any product, which is why it\'s not a ding on the product, but expect to live at about 50% brightness if you want this keyboard to last.- Good news, the wrist rest doesn\'t directly attach to the keyboard, which is nice because I like repositioning it.  Bad news, it\'s not as comfortable as I would have liked.  But I didn\'t buy this keyboard for the wrist rest.  I\'ll keep using it a bit longer but good chance I\'ll replace it with a better product.  The foam is a bit stiffer than I would have liked.  I think a gel product would have been much nicer, but this is way better than nothing.  This is a 1000% personal preference.  Some people will love it, some people will hate it, others like me will be like, eh, it\'s not terrible.OverallThis could have been easily a five star product, but Razer consciously made a handful of ignorant decisions that at least don\'t impact the performance of the device.  On top of all this, their software requirements and practices border on DRM levels of connectivity to use a keyboard.  I\'ll switch back to Corsair.  At least I can save EVERY function to a hardware profile, and then unload the software.  Plus their wireless devices stay connected.','2020-05-22 14:01:00',1,6,280),(796,'  At $230, this is without a doubt the most expensive keyboard I have ever bought. But I literally have nothing else to complain about. The build quality is top notch. Solid, does not warp, does not bend. I type with heavy keystrokes and the keys (green by Razer definition, comparable to blue switches) responded perfectly without wilting. The clickiness is great. Reminds me of the early IBM keyboards. Love it.I didn\'t know I need the dedicated media keys. I know I do now. I do wish to top of the media keys lid up instead of just the bottom. The volume dial is decent. It has discrete notches but not every notch translate into a step in the volume up/down. A bit strange for me.The wrist rest is GREAT! Soft, comfortable but extremely supportive. Even though the keyboard is a bit thick, making the key a little high, the wrist rest made it possible to still type comfortably without leading to carpal tunnel pain.Also love the fact that I can yank the USB cable and switch it over to 2.4GHz for wireless operations. It has Bluetooth also but I didn\'t have a reason to try it.Knowing what I know now, would I buy it again? Yes.','2021-12-19 23:16:54',4,4,280),(797,'  The lights work with razer chroma settings sporadically.  I set ut to stay on the wave design and it works maybe 10% of the time. The other times 8t just cycles through a single color at a time.The biggest problem though,  it randomly stops recognizing when you\'re holding a key down. For movement in a game, this is catastrophic. I have tried every single thing suggested on the razer web site, which is difficult to navigate when you have a problem. Ive also tried every thing I could find on forums. I\'ve Uninstallerd razer synapse and every razer software and reinstalled. I\'ve updated and reinstalled drivers. I\'ve tried plugging it in instead of wireless. I\'ve reconfigured my settings on my pc. None of this has fixed it. It will stop for a while and then it comes back. When it\'s happening, the timing is random too. Sometimes I can run forward for 30 seconds, and sometimes I can\'t run forward for more than a second.I bought a razer headset at the same time and it\'s been giving me a lot of issues too. Its been 4 to 5 years since I last bought razer products, and I didn\'t have any issues with those beyond initial setup.Also their software is just awful, they don\'t interact well with each other, they don\'t recognize the changes I make most of the time to the RGB lighting.I am no longer a fan of this brand and will never buy from them again.','2019-11-18 14:15:00',1,13,280),(798,'  This keyboard is awesome and I like the way the key functions change color so you can tell even in the dark what you are pressing.Pros:Bright LEDsFunction macros are easy to programYellow linear switches feel just as good as Cherry MX RedsComfy wrist pad (although I worry about its longevity)Heavy and stays put on my deskHyperspeed is fast and works as advertisedBattery life is impressive even with the lighting turned to 100%Cons:Key caps fell kind of cheap for a keyboard at this price point.

I had been watching it for a while and finally decided to buy it.  It is not cheap, and being a Razer product, I was expecting something really good.  Instead, I am returning the keyboard due to really poor performance.After I received the keyboard I immediately removed it from the packaging and plugged it in so it would charge.  Once fully charged, I kept the keyboard plugged in via the supplied USB cable to do the setup and customization.  I did not want to drain the battery at all during this processes.  Once everything was setup, I \"Synced\" the keyboard to the computer using the supplied 2.4 GHz Hyperspeed Dongle.  Once all setup was complete, I disconnected the USB cable so I could use it wirelessly.My first issue with the keyboard is how loud it is.  I did my research on this keyboard before buying it and selected the Yellow keys - \"silent and linear\".  I fully understand mechanical keys are not perfectly silent, but this is the loudest keyboard I have ever used, and I have been in the technology field for a long time, so I have used some old mechanical keyboards.  This is the least of my issues with the keyboard, as this could possibly be ignored, but it was an issue, so I wanted to make sure to get it out there that this is a LOUD keyboard.My second issue was the connection.  This keyboard would lose connection at times when using the \"Hyperspeed\" connection.  I would have to patiently wait a while for it to connect again, or turn the keyboard off and back on again.  Please note, the computer is only about 3 feet away from the keyboard with nothing obstructing the signal between the two items.  I decided to try the Bluetooth connection...no luck.  My computer has no problem detecting other Bluetooth devices, no matter what the device is, the age, or the brand.  However, my computer could never \"find\" this keyboard.  I even tried making sure it was the only Bluetooth device in the area turned on, and it still never found it.  So, my only course of action was to plug the \"wireless\" keyboard in with the supplied USB cable to ensure I would not lose connection with the computer.My third issue.  Not sure how to describe this, but it would randomly do things.  After having the wireless keyboard plugged in as a wired keyboard (if you can\'t tell I am frustrated about this, I am), I would be typing and it would randomly open the start menu or task manager.  Other times it would just randomly throw up a string of letters that I didn\'t type.  I am not sure how this happened, and only happened a few times before I decided to box this up and start the return process, but it was weird and random.  I have never seen that before with.My final issue, and perhaps the most important was the battery life.  As I indicated earlier I let the keyboard fully charge before using, and I kept it plugged in while doing the initial setup.  I had the keyboard unplugged and working as a wireless keyboard for maybe a little over an hour before reconnecting to become a wired keyboard.  Of course, during that time I had the lights going and was using it as a normal keyboard (not gaming, just internet and email) and of course fighting the connection issues.  When I pugged the keyboard back in and went back into the Razer Synapse application, I noticed the battery charge had dropped to 76%.  WHAT?!?!?!  In just over an hour the battery was drained 24%?  This is ridiculous.  The keyboard I was replacing (and now using for this review) is a wireless backlit keyboard that only needs to be charged once every few months.  This keyboard would not even make it through a full day using it as designed with lights active.  I could not imagine anyone using this for gaming as it would surely die before the game is finished.So my options now were to either leave the keyboard plugged in, which defeats the purpose of buying a wireless keyboard (and deal with the weird random letters and opening of other applications); or turning the light effects off to save battery life, which defeats the purpose of buying an expensive RGB keyboard.  Either way, I would not get what I paid a lot of money for.  So, I am returning the keyboard.','2017-08-09 09:00:00',4,9,283),(800,'  Physically this keyboard is ok. There is a problem with the occasional key spamming. The major problem is with Razer Synapse. This program made the keyboard virtually unusable. With the program active these are some of the problems I encountered:1. Lighting would never activate2. Setup instructions need to be more detailed. Still don\'t know if I did it right. Program provided no feedback,3. Keyboard would take up to 10 sec to activate when coming out of sleep mode4. Numerous time after coming out of sleep mode my task bar would lock up. The icons in the bar were unresponsive and would not engage when I tried to click on them. The only way I could correct this was to open the Task Manager which would override Synapse and allow me to access the items in my Task Bar.After disengaging Synapse these problems (except for the occasional key spamming) went away and the keyboard works fine.For the amount of money I spent for this item I should not have had these problems. I tried working with Razer\'s support with limited success. Until there is a total rework of Synapse I believe these problems will persistUpdate: After a lot of back and forth with Razer Support someone recommend that I check the Firmware  and if necessary update it. After completing the update most of my issues disappeared. If you are having similar issues to mine I recommend you try this to resolve your issues.To Razer checking the firmware should be made automatic in the \"Check Updates\" tab and update steps be incorporated if found to be outdated.','2021-03-14 17:00:00',3,16,283),(801,'  I didn\'t buy this for gaming - just for normal daily work as I type a lot and wanted a better keyboard. The quality is obvious and I expect it will last for many years. The key action is very crisp, they\'re slightly indented so they have a good feel around your finger, and the plastic is nice to touch. All great things.For people that are interested in all sorts of different color schemes, I\'m sure they can get whatever they want - there are many built in options and then also the ability to fully customize.All of that said, I nearly packed the keyboard up and sent it back right (hence the 4 stars). The keyboard worked without the Swarm software, but there was no way to turn off the colors - only dim them or turn off the lighting completely. Without back-lighting, it would be very difficult to see the key caps so that\'s really not an option.After downloading Swarm and starting the installation, some Microsoft components had to be installed on my 64-win Win10 machine. That\'s fine, but then my PC hard rebooted without warning. After the reboot, nothing appeared installed so I started the process again. This time it went straight the Swarm software (so the MSFT components evidently completed), and that appeared to install without a problem, but then after starting Swarm the only option was to do a software update - and I had just downloaded the LATEST software available from their website!?Swarm didn\'t give me any real options other than to update again, but when I did that it appeared to hang and after about 5 minutes I killed the app. I tried to reinstall - ended up de-installing everything and then reinstalling everything again. Once again I was given the only choice of updating. As this caused a problem before, I went on-line looking for a manual or any information - there isn\'t one as far as I can tell, and there wasn\'t any information in the box other than to install Swarm!With nowhere else to go, I went ahead and updated my software once again, and once again the app appeared to hang. Fortunately I was called away for about 45 minutes as when I came back, the keyboard lights were off, I couldn\'t use it to log back in, and there were four white lights blinking on the bottom right of the keyboard. With no way to log in, I unplugged the USB, plugged it back in, and then the keyboard started back up and I was able to login.The screen in front of me had instructions to unplug and plug the keyboard back in as it had done a firmware upgrade! Unannounced. With no explanation. With no manual. With no help options discussing this.Roccat - in case it isn\'t abundantly clear, it is unacceptable to do a silent firmware upgrade! Please put some instructions up on your website - but that\'s the backup plan Swarm itself should tell users what it\'s doing and give a rough estimate of how long it will take. Had you done that, other than MSFT\'s hard reboot, installing the keyboard would have been a breeze.P.S. I\'ve enjoyed writing this review. The keys really do feel great and I believe I type faster on it.','2021-01-05 23:30:00',5,11,283),(802,'  I\'m not concerned at all with RGB features, and actually find them a bit off-putting and tacky. I bought this solely on the basis of the reviews of the keys and build quality. Admittedly I do love the feel of the keys, and it is a beautiful looking keyboard. However, it does have a few shortcomings and the absence of some common features seem like a bit of a missed opportunity....First off, the images make it look like it\'s built like a tank, with the lovely brushed aluminium top - however, it still has a bit of flex that I was not expecting. The hand rest attaches magnetically which is a nice touch, but it\'s very hard and not at all comfortable. The dedicated media keys are inadequate. I don\'t want to have to hit shortcuts to play/pause music. The volume control is nice but at a minimum I would expect dedicated skip, stop, play/pause buttons, in addition to the mute button. Pretty much standard on other \'premium\' keyboards. I\'m a huge fan of macro keys, but Macro keys via multi-key press shortcuts is completely pointless in my opinion. I use macro keys heavily on my other keyboards because I program them to replace otherwise additional key presses. I\'ll never use what they have attempted to implement here. Finally, they really should have included a USB port. Even if they couldn\'t make it a pass-thru type, I\'d happily deal with an extra connector at the end of the cable to get this feature.Overall, it is a very nicely presented keyboard and the keys are top notch. Unless a \'unicorn\' solution comes along, I have no intention of replacing the AIMO despite the absence of the features mentioned above. If you are in to all the RGB stuff, this has customizable features by the boatload and you will probably get more out of it than I do in that regard.So in summary, five stars for appearance and key quality, less one star for poor implementation of some features (media keys, macro functionality, hand rest) and for the missing USB port... and finally, less one more star for the price, which in my opinion is too high given the aforementioned flaws','2013-06-09 11:00:00',5,12,283),(803,'  Notes:- The RGB effects are very, very cool, completely love the design. The Roccat Swarm software used to control it also works as intended. Roccat swarm software can also be used to make macros and reassign keys. Nice.- About the RBG , one thing that bothers me slightly is that the intelligent lighting has a significant delay between keypress and light (approx 0.5 seconds, sometimes more. Just feels a little bit sluggish)- The titan switches feel very good. They are not loud at all but have a very nice mechanical actuation- The letters on the keys are not painted but rather they are spaces in the opaque layer where the LED lighting shines through. This makes it impossible to scratch off the letters, but also makes the letters not visible when the LEDs are turned off.- There is a knob on the top right for controlling both RGB brightness and volume. There\'s also a mute button. Both are very handy- The individual keys have larger than normal spaces in-between them. This requires a little bit of a learning curve. In the beginning my fingers were tripping over the edges of the keys. After a bit of practice I found myself liking the spaces more than I thought I would--it encourages better typing accuracy and actually feels more satisfying (maybe it\'s just me?)- Full size keyboard. I WISH they had a numpad-less version!Overall, incredible keyboard. A+. Recommend. Yay Roccat!','2014-05-20 05:30:00',1,3,283),(804,'            Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n        \n\n\n   I needed a high quality and \"all around\" keyboard both for productivity as well as gaming. I believe that you can have both but it\'s very hard to find something that can do both well especially at an affordable price point. Some of these keyboards can easily hit $250+ and by that point, are you sure you wanna waste your hard earned money on something you could easily spill a drink on and ruin in the blink of an eye?  When it comes to keyboards, there are so many options to pick from - membrane vs mechanical keyboards, normal vs low profile, and of course the various cherry mx switches (brown, red, silver, blue, black, etc). I think it took me around 2 days before I finally came up with personal preferences (you should probably do the same).  I went to microcenter and tried out the various keyboards they had on display (Corsair K70 / K95, Razer Huntsman Elite / Chroma, Logitech G915 / Pro X). I also took hours out of my day and listened to various YouTube videos on the differences between all of the cherry mx switches.I wanted something right in the middle - clicks not too quiet but not too loud, design not too aggressive looking but not too basic either, font something professional but also relaxing to look at, and something practical to use without running into too many gimmicks. I always preferred low profile keyboards because for me, the normal profile keyboards are too big, bulky, and in my opinion, a remnant of the 90s. After hours of typing and gaming, your fingers get tired of wrestling around with the keys. At the same time, you don\'t want a super sensitive keyboard either that registers a hit just as soon as you breathe in its general direction. For this reason I decided to go with the cherry red & brown switches (the best \"all around\" switches for typing AND gaming). Both of them have the same activation force (45cn) and are fairly quiet but audible enough, the only difference being, the brown switches have a tactile feedback whereas the red switches are linear. Think of this tactile feedback as a minor \"bump\" in the road to let you know the conditions of the road without actually seeing the potholes. Being a fairly confident typist, I decided to go with the cherry reds since the tactile feedback could in theory become tiresome over long periods of time. Keep in mind even with linear keys, you can still feel the key so it\'s not like you are typing on nothing. It comes down to more or less \"clicky\" feeling. Finally, the RGB lights. I had no real preference on them. They look cool but at the end of the day, they are just fancy lights you don\'t really need for gaming or typing.My research was complete so I dropped by microcenter. Keyboards everywhere, most of them the same generic 90s keyboards I dreaded using but with a price tag of $150 and above. One keyboard definitely stuck out above all others - the Roccat Vulcan. A sturdy aluminum plate, low profile keys with the switches visually exposed, and an overall sleek design with multimedia controls, I immediately knew I had to touch it.  I hopped on, opened a word document, and started typing. It didn\'t disappoint one bit. It performed just as well as it looked.  I powered through sentences as fast as I could type them (last I checked, my wpm was around 50-60). Minimal mistakes were made and that\'s solely because I didn\'t have a chair to sit on. Only one final test remained - gaming. Seeing as microcenter didn\'t have any available games (or chairs for that matter), I decided to pull the trigger.3 days later my keyboard came in and once again it didn\'t disappoint.  This keyboard, personally for me, is built as close to perfection as possible. Hitting the keys are now so incredibly satisfying now and they feel incredible. I love everything about the keyboard. It\'s great for long term typing and gaming - going on 5 hours now no problem. It\'s visually pleasing to look at, even without the RGB lights but the lights do make it even more of a pleasure to look at. I didn\'t fool around with the lights too much yet but there is a program (Swarm) that lets you customize the light patterns  as well as setup multiple profiles and macros. The keyboard also comes with a magnetic wrist rest and braided cable to let you know it\'s of high quality design. Most importantly, the $120 price tag is extremely reasonable for a keyboard of this quality (I believe it\'s $150 at microcenter).  Most of its best selling competitors are $150 and up and they don\'t even look half as good. The K70 low profile starts at $160 as well as the Razer Huntsman Elite. I\'m a huge fan of the DeathAdder (my current mouse) but Razer Huntmans Elite keyboard clicks were EXTREMELY audible and I hear their build quality has fallen off in the past few years. Roccat is a German manufacturer so when they advertise that they take pride in their builds, I can believe it.I haven\'t run into any cons yet, at least nothing noticeable. As for improvements to future models, I know Corsair includes a USB port on their keyboard as well as a giant X underneath the keyboard through which cables can be run and held in place - both of which this keyboard lacks. Not a complaint from my end as I have more USB ports on my rig than I know what to do with and the cable\'s length is long enough - around 5-6ft I believe. The final test for this keyboard is the reliability test. I\'m hoping it lasts for at least 3 years. I will report back if I run into any issues with soft or hardware.Final verdict: 10/10 - I highly recommend it.','2014-01-11 02:00:00',1,18,283),(805,'  I bought this keyboard on 4/20/2020. It was great for a few months, then sometime in August, the \"a\" key and \"Left Shift\" key stopped being as responsive. As a gamer, I would mostly notice this in game when trying to strafe left or crouch/crouch move. I did all the steps the Amazon tech suggested, who then recommended to reach out to the manufacturer to ask for a replacement. The manufacturer gave me similar steps with a couple additional ones, which did not resolve the issue at all. The \"Left Shift\" key is extremely noticeable when typing now. The manufacturer did say it\'s likely a faulty switch, but neither them, nor Amazon is willing to respond to resolve the issue. DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS KEYBOARD.','2014-02-18 06:00:00',1,14,283),(806,'  I was in the market for a new \"daily driver\" all rounder keyboard and this one caught my eye. After reading the specs and actually watching a review on Youtube I decided to pull the trigger. I wanted to like this keyboard. Spending this much on a keyboard I wanted to like it very much... but from the time it arrived shipped in its own retail box (no outer box...  shame on you Amazon) I was disappointed. For this price they have set the bar rather high for themselves and unfortunately they missed the mark in almost every respect.The LEDs are blinding! The secondary functions on the key caps are barely visible unless you have the LEDs turned up all the way. At which point they become VERY distracting. When viewed from even the slightest of angles it becomes the first keyboard I feel I need to shield my eyes from...Bad switch. You can slowly press  a key down past the \" tactile bump\" a MEASURABLE  distance before the key stroke registers. This distance varies from key to key as does the severity of the tactile bump. The action feels rough and gritty. It is not pleasant nor is it comfortable to type on. I felt my fingers begin to fatigue just minutes into use.  There is very little key wobble but at the sacrifice of smooth action. In games the action was too stiff. I felt my movement to be hindered and was missing the easiest of shots.The software is what I have come to expect from these companies...Basic. Bare-bones. One of the biggest features missing is the ability to layer lighting effects.They key caps are ABS and have a nice almost velvety texture that will be lost to finger shine within the first day of use.  They are produced in house for this switch. Aftermarket key caps will not fit these switches.There is so much keyboard flex it feels like you can twist the thing into a pretzel. The aluminum top plate is very thin and seems to be there more for looks than actual rigidity.The wrist rest is not padded and is uncomfortable.The highest quality feature of this item is the volume control dial. Very definitive steps and felt well made.For this price there are FAR better options out there. This keyboard is over thought and under engineered. It is way over priced for what you are getting.','2021-12-19 23:16:51',5,19,283),(807,'  I bought this keyboard a month ago along with the roccat leadr mouse.  I\'ve had nothing but problems with both products.  The keyboard is beautiful and feels great and I would love to say I loved it.  But periodically the lights stop moving and the swarm software just hangs.  Talking to support has been slow and painful.  They have had me reinstall the software to no avail.  I\'ve adjusted to just living with this.  As long as I don\'t use the sofware or reboot my computer it seems to work fairly reliably.  Course after a reboot or if I use the control panel to change lighting settings on the keyboard there is a good chance it will hang.  Once it does there is no fix other than unplugging the keyboard and plugging it back in.  I really wish I could fix this as I like the keyboard quite a bit.  Now on to post about the leadr mouse.','2021-12-19 23:16:52',2,8,283),(808,'  UPDATED REVIEW:I\'ve had this keyboard exactly a week now and I am still very pleased with it. It\'s one of the best keyboards I\'ve ever used. It seems well made and like it should hold up for a number of years if you take care of it. I\'m very pleased.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I searched for a good mechanical keyboard for about 2 months. Originally I wanted a tenkeyless keyboard, and I actually purchased the Corsair K100 TKL, but it had silver speed switches on that were way too sensitive. It was great to game with though, but terrible for typing. I wished this keyboard had brown/tactile switches, but because it didn\'t I ended up sending it back. I type on a keyboard much more than I game with one. Then I got the Logitech G915 at a great price on eBay (nearly $100 off brand new). I thought I\'d be pleased with that keyboard, but it was a bigger disappointment than the Corsair K100 TKL. I don\'t recommend it. I looked at a few other keyboards, and even bought another one from Corsair (from their website) and cancelled it because it didn\'t ship in nearly three weeks.In all of my research, I had come across this one from time to time. The thing that kept me from buying it was that I thought the keys being raised were a gimmick and wouldn\'t be that easy to type with. Well, I was wrong. This keyboard is super easy to type with, and is one of the best keyboards I have ever used. Correction, IT IS the best keyboard I have ever used. Typing on this thing is effortless.I have the tactical version of this keyboard, which is similar to brown switches. The RGB lighting is great on it right out of the box, and that\'s why I used (the default). The look of this keyboard is very sleek with black brushed aluminum, and doesn\'t feel cheap at all. Aside from typing, that\'s another thing I love about it. It looks cool on my desk. And the slim form factor is right up my alley. Coming from a Corsair K55 full sized keyboard, I didn\'t want another big and bulky board. But this one is perfect - even with the palm rest. When it comes to typing, the sound is not loud at all. It\'s a very satisfying tactile sound, that most probably won\'t pick up on if you\'re in a Zoom / Teams / web meeting. either. The keys sound great when typing. The volume knob is simple to use, and instead of twisting it, I usually just place my hand to the side of it and scroll it backward or forward. It has a tactile feel as well, and is easy to control. I haven\'t had a chance to game with it, so I can\'t speak on that, but it seems like it should be no problem. I could go on and on, but I don\'t want to be longwinded. Other people have left great reviews, and they were right.Lastly, I was able to catch this keyboard on sale for $109.99, which was $50 off the regular price. I probably would\'ve bought it anyway, but still - I\'m happy about that. I recommend it.','2021-12-19 23:16:53',4,12,283),(809,'  Brown switches are great for typing.  Terrible for gaming.  I was hoping the 0.2mm reduction in actuation and travel was going to be the difference maker - it wasn\'t.  Mechanical switches that aren\'t \"speed\" are absolutely bad for gaming.  Just don\'t.This keyboard killed my joy for gaming so much when I was trying to adjust,  so much that I ended up not playing anything because I hated the feel of my favorite games.  The key press and actuation are still way too long for gaming.  While this is better than the Philips that I tried, it\'s still way too much over priced and over hyped for what it achieves.I only considered it namely because it had more of the features that I wanted in  keyboard than others, but the volume knob is terribly placed and implemented that it may as well be missing.  A stiff volume knob is fine, but when it requires a thumb and forefinger to use, having it so close to the upper keys will interfere, and that makes it more of  hassle to use than it\'s worth.  Also, requiring software installed in order to change ANYTHING about the RGB is a no-no.While I got it on sale, I can\'t even recommend it at the sale price.While I like brown switches for typing, the tactile response seems diminished with this iteration, and the travel is still too long.  So much so, that I am considering permanently returning to mecha-membrane or the like switches, because mechanical is in the sorriest state right now.  The \"fastest\" switches are without tactile feedback, which I enjoy, and ruins my enjoyment.','2021-12-19 23:16:54',1,6,284),(810,'  This keyboard is amazing but not for the clumsy. If you\'ve spilled a drink on your keyboard more than 3 times in your life I may say avoid it as it takes days to unstick your keys and you can\'t remove them, just the caps. Stay for tips on how to clean this thing. Overall this thing is sleek, solid, and sexy. I have the cherry red keys but would have loved to have tried the brown. It was important for me to have a quiet, wireless keyboard so having a corded mechanical keyboard wasn\'t even on my mind. After a few videos learning about mechanical keyboards I decided to give this one a go, was pleasantly surprised plus the braided cord on this is stylish. It\'s quieter than my last Logitech keyboard, more responsive, lower profile with all of the functionality, but not as comfortable as the hand rest they provide (detachable) is just hard plastic. This was 100% a style decision because it looks good but feels like crap. Roccat should definitely create a comfortable attachable wrist rest and give a discount to those who purchased this with the hard plastic one. Like me. Let\'s talk about how to clean this thing if you have any accidents. Please note, I\'m not responsible for your messing up your own keyboard, nor is the company. This has worked for me.Cleaning:If you are clumsy enough to have spilled a sticky drink over your ballin new keyboard the way to get it back in order is to use rubbing alcohol with some q-tips. Unplug your keyboard. Remove the black cap of the sticky keys affected, dip the q-tip in some rubbing, stronger the better, and press the wet q-tip into the exposed sticky key. It\'s fine if the clear capsule gets a bunch of rubbing alcohol in it. Constantly press the keys as quickly as you can to spread the rubbing alcohol and clean away whatever drink got there in the first place. Do about 3 times a day. As you press on the keys you\'ll notice it feels normal however the stickiness will return after it sets for awhile. You have to this for about 4 days for everything to be back to normal, you will notice it getting progressively better.Quick review:-The lighting effects are great i just wish the ripple effect was able to remain backlit with a solid color while in use. It\'s the greatest preset but hard to use in the dark. No, the wave effect isn\'t the same.-I\'ve seen people talking about the edge of the keys being sharp on youtube, wth are they doing with this keyboard? Just type on it. lol- The knob can use some more graphics, even just lines. It\'s a feature but it\'s bland on your keyboard. Maybe it\'ll help if it were metal-  I\'m glad they didn\'t use the traditional cherry keys. Roccat Keys are lit, literally. The height of the clear portion makes the keys hover which is classy. Everyone should follow this model. I think the roccat team can go above and beyond and make these module and dominate the field.- Now that I know how to clean this thing, I love it. Guys, get rid of the two screws above the F1 and F4 keys, I just noticed them while writing the review.- I\'m not using this keyboard as a gamer, I\'m a designer. I have little need to use the game mode but the software should let you change the function of the keys for various software and detect that software like my logi mx master mouse does.That\'s it guys. TLDR. The keyboard is good. If you aren\'t someone who cares about style and you don\'t care about lights, but you care about silence, you can go for a switch-key. I like this one though, I\'d buy again. Your friends will notice this keyboard when they visit.','2021-12-19 23:16:55',5,7,284),(811,'  All of a sudden out of the blue this thing just started going bananas. The keyboard starting doing over 13 THOUSAND key strokes a second, opening all type of apps, settings, you name it. After all that my PC finally crashed but the damage this caused was so bad I was forced to reformat my PC.','2021-12-18 19:29:38',3,18,284),(812,'  The review is about the Apex Pro Keyboard, NOT Apex 7.Adjusting the actuation is great! I can feel the difference in games with their super fast actuation. Typing is just the reverse though, I have a lot of typos with the super fast actuation. Which isn\'t a problem at all, because you can switch profiles on the fly and have one of the best typing experiences imaginable with super deep 3.6 mm actuation point. It\'s like having multiple keyboards at once, and being able to change them effortlessly to suit the task at hand.Some disadvantages I\'d like to point out:- Not waterproof. Be careful with it.- Only the main block uses omnipoint switches. Not a big issue considering you don\'t really use the other keys, but that\'s a good reason to make a 60% or TKL Keyboard with only omnipoint switches, no? After using TKL keyboards I\'ve really appreciate the extra space. I highly recommend the TKL version over the full one, once it actually releases.- O-rings will prevent the 3.6mm actuation point from working properly, and I really didn\'t like how O-rings felt on this keyboard. Not really an issue considering that the keyboard is already quite silent even without any O-rings.','2021-12-19 23:16:57',1,1,284),(813,'  I\'m on the fence with this keyboard, so I\'m giving it stars down the middle to represent not bad, not great.First up the price. Well, it\'s not worth what I paid for by any means. I did keep the keyboard, so I can safely say that I wasted some $$ on this. Half the price would be more reasonable.Rest of the keyboard is about as others have reviewed. The colors and software you run (I\'m on Win10x64) all work well and I\'ve had no issues. I already owned a SteelSeries mouse, so there wasn\'t any additional setup for me on the software front. The keyboard showed up in their software and I was immediately able to start playing around with settings. As I expected, this is a rather clicky keyboard - if there were 5 or so clicking at the same time, you\'d think you were in a news room. My previous keyboards were much softer touch and produced next to no sound, so the difference is a bit jarring at times. I\'d tried to switch over to a more standard gaming keyboard several times over the past couple years and this is the latest attempt.There are a couple things I was disappointed in and one of them I guess was just ignorance on my part of what the thing does. First up, the software works like crap when you put it in the dual mode to keep colors in sync between a keyboard and mouse. Settings are suddenly limited to lowest common denominator, so if you have thoughts of doing this, forget it. Fairly easy to just set up each separately to kind of match.Second up is this adjustable pressure. Silly me, I thought it would actually adjust the pressure you \"could\" apply to the keys. Well, that\'s not the case. It\'s influences the amount of pressure you \"need\" to apply to the key to get it to see the key was pushed. On the lightest touch setting, just barely rubbing your finger across the key will trigger a push. And then on the highest setting, you have to push all the way down on the key. While this is supposed to be the big selling point of this keyboard, it\'s not that impressive. It does work as advertised, now that I understand the advertising. It just doesn\'t seem to make any difference in what I do at all. I\'ve been PC gaming since the 2 color screen days, so I\'ve used so many different keyboards, I can\'t count them all. This is just another one to me. I\'m likely to never remember back and think \"holy button push\", that was a pivotal moment with this awesome keyboard!That said, this isn\'t a bad keyboard at all. I\'m keeping and testing to see if my years of typing possibly change as I use it. I like the colors. I like the extra USB plug. I\'m on the fence about the little wheel and useless screen in the upper right.If you\'ve got $$ burning a hole in your pocket, go for it. If you\'re debating on spending this much for something and not sure if it\'s worth it, it\'s not.','2021-12-19 23:16:58',5,7,284),(814,'  Unsure if these issues were because I bought it renewed, but here we go. Keyboard is very comfortable, construction quality seems to be pretty high. Unfortunately so is the key sensitivity, which I assume can be adjusted. You will find that keys will register as being pushed when they weren\'t. It\'s a deal breaker for online games like over watch where abilities have cool downs and the keyboard decides to use them without you touching keys. It also is kind of a bummer when trying to type in general as certain keys will \"stick\" and type 1000 times. Luckily, I returned the keyboard the day I got it as the problems were immediately apparent and went back to my old one. Still searching for a more comfortable keyboard that\'s good for gaming!','2021-12-19 23:16:59',5,10,284),(815,'  I got this and a Rival wired mouse for my son’s birthday.  He plays a lot of Roblox with his friends and I constantly hear him hammer fisting his desk in anger because his wireless keyboard and mouse would lag and make him vulnerable in shooter games.  He was so excited to get the keyboard and mouse.  Not only does it look super cool, but you can adjust the actuation of the keys.  You can make it so you barely have to touch the key, to fully pressing the key all the way down in order to send the command.  The keyboard feels like it\'s built to last, nice and sturdy, and has a real nice mechanical feel when typing.  I pop in every now and then when he\'s playing a Roblox shooter game with his friends and ask if the keyboard and mouse are working alright.  He always tells me they work flawlessly, in fact he said his click speed is a lot faster now.  I\'m not gamer, but I understand your competition will kick your butt if you\'re playing with sub par tools.  It\'s been a week and I have yet to hear any angry hammer fisting of his desk.?  In fact, I was watching him play the other night when a Roblox YouTuber joined his server.  He got all excited  and said the person was one of the highest ranked players in the game he was playing.  He took out the YouTuber several times, but ultimately came in second to him each round until the YouTuber moved on.  My son was totally stoked and said there\'s no way he would have been able to compete with the old wireless keyboard and mouse.  Awesome, you don\'t always hit a home run with presents, but this might be one.  If only it would make him excited to do his homework.?','2020-09-10 03:00:00',5,8,284),(816,'  I\'ve been looking for a worthy replacement for my Logitech 810, a no-frills, mechanical, RGB keyboard with a relatively small footprint, and this SteelSeries Apex Pro is everything I need and nothing I don\'t.The finish is a pleasant feeling matte black which looks nice and doesn\'t show fingerprints. The edges are also rounded which makes using the keyboard on my lap more comfortable. Construction feels solid but the keyboard is relatively light weight and doesn\'t feel cumbersome to lift or move.I\'m not an expert on switches but the keys feel really nice. I messed around a bit with the adjustable actuation software, and it\'s pretty cool, though I ended up sticking with the default setting. The lighting is lovely, bright, and sufficiently customizable. One feature about the lighting that made me want to buy this keyboard is that the SHIFT characters on the number row keys are illuminated. It\'s baffling how more expensive competing products fail to do that.The mini OLED screen on the keyboard is more or less worthless for practical real-world use, but it\'s aesthetically pleasing, and you can add your own image, so I\'m not mad. I was concerned because one Youtube review described the OLED/media scroll and button as feeling cheap and flimsy, but I don\'t find that to be true.If I had to criticize anything, I\'d say the footprint might actually be too small. There is practically nowhere to grip the keyboard if you have to pick it up. First world problems.','2020-05-22 14:01:00',4,6,284),(817,'  When a rogue Win 10 update took out my Gskill KM780 RGB unexpectedly, I had to pull the trigger fast on a new KB instead of having to endure using my spare membrane board.  After a solid day of research, I took a chance on the Apex Pro.Coming from Cherry MX Browns, I had some reservations about OmniPoint.  The Browns have a tactile point which I liked.  I had tried MX Reds, and wasn\'t a fan of the linear feel.  With these Omni switches being linear, I was unsure but somehow compelled to pass on the Apex 7 with MX Browns and go Pro.  TBH, I was half expecting to return it.  Needless to say.... I was surprised when I hooked this up!First off... dat switch.  Wow.  SUPER smooth.  The inherent scratchiness of linear MX switches is GONE.  It feels like the keycaps are just sort of floating over the brushed aluminum base.  The adjustment ability is unique compared to most mechanical boards, bringing a true Hall Effect switch to people.  (Look up Hall Effect... gets a little complex for explanation here, but very cool)  Actuation can be adjusted from a light brush on the keys (probably overkill) to making the switch bottom out completely.  This can also be done on a per key basis. Lot of range to play with!Another key strength... the RGB lighting.  Its nothing short of fantastic.  The raised caps let the bright and vibrant lighting spill over the board itself, creating a very cool and clean lighting effect.  Even for those who don\'t much care about RGB lighting, it\'s very tastefully done here.Typing is unreal.  I spent 15 mins just typing random weirdness on a word doc just for them feels when I first hooked it up.  And for some reason, I find myself with a lot less errors compared to old board with the Browns.  I\'d commonly get keypress duplication (as if I held the key down) with that switch, and with these Omni switches, it doesn\'t happen anymore.  Of course, these Omni switches are much quieter than the tactile Browns given their linear nature.Not much bad to say here.  Some minor gripes would be somewhat \"meh\" software from Steelseries and the keycaps being ABS instead of something like double-shot PBT caps.  The latter feel much sturdier and more premium, and I suppose one could buy some PBT caps if it was a huge issue.  Not sure how that would affect the lighting though.  The small B&W OLED screen in the upper right doesn\'t add much in reality, but its kind of a geeky fun thing that you can customize with whatever you want.  It does have some functionality with brightness and other features, which is nice to have versus having to use the software.  Also, only the primary keys have Omni switches.  All the F keys, num pad, and extra function keys are on a generic linear switch that feels good enough.  Would be nice to have all keys on omni switches, but it makes sense from a cost perspective and isn\'t a big deal to me.All in all, fantastic keyboard that towers over my old Gskill in every respect.  I really wish MS terrible updates hadn\'t bricked old board, but I guess things happen for a reason.  If you have the cash and want a great analog-based mechanical keyboard with adjustable hall effect switches.... this is the one for you.  Very hard to fault this board.  Steelseries done good here.','2021-12-19 23:16:54',3,3,284),(818,'  UPDATE: I still really like this keyboard, but I was starting to notice that I actually type really inaccurately on it - it does get annoying. I just make a lot of mistakes, and I\'ve been typing for 40 years and normally type about 100wpm. I was trying to figure out why this is, and lately I\'ve had my old IBM Model M in the room hooked up to another computer and have felt the obvious difference in accuracy. (The Model M is where the modern keyboard layout comes from.) I still just type much better on the Model M. So I directly compared the two keyboards to figure out what the difference is.Obviously the Model M is bigger overall, but my big realization is that the actual key layout on the Model M is slightly wider. It\'s not just a difference in the \"dead space\" in between keyboard sections, either - there is actually slightly less space between each key on the Steelseries keyboard. I\'ve compared all the keyboards I\'ve owned against the Model M and while some have had minor layout variations and most these days have the function keys much closer to the main keys, this is the first time I\'ve seen keys that were actually closer together. I\'m sure it\'s not the only keyboard like that, but it\'s the only one I\'ve owned that is and it explains my typing inaccuracy on it. I\'ve taken a star off my original review for that reason. It is just not a full size keyboard, even though it looks like it is. It feels cramped, and I\'ve never gotten fully adjusted to it.My original review is below:----------------------------------------For the price, it had better be good. And it is. My score is 5 stars but consider it more like 4 1/2 rounded up. A bit closer to 5 than 4; not perfect but nearly so. I\'ll explain.I\'m both a typist and a gamer, but these days probably more of the former than the latter. Still, I try to find keyboards good for both purposes, and many are - heck, the old IBM Model M is still a great gaming keyboard if you don\'t need n-key rollover (and to be honest, most people really don\'t). But my old Motospeed keyboard, which I loved for its feel and its small footprint (as small as it gets for a full size keyboard) seemed to just wear out - it started repeating keypresses constantly, so I decided I\'d just go for something new rather than try to fix it. (But I probably will fix it at some point; it\'s a great keyboard too.)This is the first linear keyboard I\'ve owned in many years. I usually prefer clicky keyboards and have since the days of the original IBM PC and the Model F. But I just wanted something different after owning clicky keyboards for so long, and my Motospeed was *really* clicky to the point that it did become a little grating after a few years. I\'d read about the wonders of the OmniPoint keyswitches in the Apex Pro and I watched the excellent Chyrosran22 review of it on YouTube (search for that; he knows keyboards and he loves this one). I did also manage to try one out for a brief few minutes, though not long enough to really form my own opinion. But in the absence of any more obvious choice, I took the plunge and bought one.Bottom line: It is a really well built keyboard (almost zero flex) that feels *almost* as good to type on as any linear keyboard I\'ve ever used in about 40 years of computing. It has double-shot keycaps so the legends won\'t wear out, it\'s got a really useful volume roller, and it\'s got a little screen that can be used for various things, most of which are kinda dumb but I do use it for displaying current system stats - there is an app to display CPU, GPU and RAM usage. Its backlighting is pretty bright, fully RGB and has some effects that are actually kinda useful - I\'m not sure what the effect I use is called, but it just lights the key you press up in white for a half-second or so before smoothly fading it back to whatever color the rest of the keyboard is backlit in. It\'s actually helpful to have a little split-second feedback showing which key you just typed, just in case you make a mistake.The OnmiPoint keyswitches do feel great - very smooth - and they\'re user-adjustable in terms of the actuation point. This is unique to this type of keyswitch, which is an uncommon magnetic sensor type of mechanical switch. I will say that I *feel* more accurate on this keyboard than my old Motospeed - I think the design and spacing of the keycaps on this keyboard is maybe a little more standard.So, that\'s that - now I\'m going to tell you about the *little* things that keep it from being perfect. Keep in mind that absolutely none of these are dealbreakers, or things other people might even necessarily think of as drawbacks. But...The cord is non-detachable and it\'s quite stiff. It\'s also just rubber insulated, which is fine, but kinda ugly on such an expensive keyboard. The keyboard has two USB plugs, one for the USB port on the keyboard itself (it won\'t act as a hub, just a pass-through), and that USB plug is on the left side of the keyboard. That means if you want the keyboard cable on the right, which the cable management on the back of the keyboard lets you do, your mouse cable will still be on the left. I feel like this is an odd design given that most people are right-handed. A choice would be best, but if you\'re going to pick a place for one USB port, put it on the right.Only the \"main\" keys are OmniPoint - that\'s everything in the little \"typewriter\" cluster, that main rectangle of letters and numbers that you type the most on. The others are either Cherry MX Red or some kind of copy of them. To be honest, I\'m not sure which switch I prefer! I know which I\'m \"supposed\" to prefer but the regular Reds on the rest of the keyboard seem to have a very slightly lighter weighting. Probably my only semi-serious complaint about the keyboard in general - and this is 100% subjective, so it\'s not a top-line item for this review - is that the OmniPoint switches are just a *tiny* bit heavier than I like, and probably as a consequence of that feel very, very slightly \"mushy\" as you reach full travel. The switches on the rest of the board, while very slightly \"grittier\", are also a tiny bit lighter and do not feel mushy. All that said, I will allow that someone else could feel entirely the opposite. This is personal preference, and anyway it\'s not a big difference. But there *is* a difference in the switches on different parts of the board, and it does sometimes feel a little odd as a result.After only several *days* of use, the soft-touch finish is already wearing off several of the keys. Now, you can see by this review that I type a *lot*. So it may take longer for you, and anyway the legends themselves will never wear off since they\'re doubleshot. But my space bar is already looking a little ugly with one part of it already noticeably shiny. I never understand this - my Model F and Model M that are 30+ years old still look brand new, while a keyboard that\'s only days old (and cost a couple hundred bucks) already has a finish that\'s wearing off.Overall, though, I think I\'ll be happy with this keyboard until I get tired of linear keys and want to go back to clicky. But who knows when or if that\'ll happen. At the moment, I\'m pleased with my purchase, even for the money. This thing does feel like an expensive keyboard.','2019-11-18 14:15:00',5,11,284),(819,'  So, I just hoooked this up. I just don\'t know yet. I have not installed software or done much of anything yet.I just trashed my G710+, which was 12 years ole and I kept getting broken keys because I type a LOT since I\'m a software engineer. But I loved the keyboard so much, I really hated to let it go.This one, right off I can say it is not as \'clicky as the G710. I also so not like the wrist wrest, at all. I don\'t like the feel of it. It\'s not very comfortable and whatever the material is, I hate the feel of it, it\'s like it\'s slick and my plams just want to slide off of it and I feel like my palms will get sweaty from laying aginat this all day.We\'ll see afte a little more use, I just don\'t know yet, so I\'ll give it a 3. I want my G710+ back! The only thing about that is the keys tend to break and it was impossible to keep it clean the way there so many crevices and space under the keys for dust to hide in.Anyway, this is funny. I went and got the palm wrest off my G710+ and the tabs on it fit right under this keyboard and I can move it around the desk without it even moving! So I\'m keeping it, the feel is so much better than the magnetic thing they sent. I like the feel of the plastic so much better than whatever that material is.Also, I cannot type as fast on thie keyboard as I could the G710+. I hink because it\'s smaller, more compact and I don\'t have tiny hands and fingers. And maybe because I\'m just not used to it, but I think it\'s because it\'s smaller.','2021-12-05 15:29:15',4,1,285),(820,'  Pros:- quietest keyboard in existence- has number pad (good for work)- quick, customizable, and elegant- disable the windows key and it has on-board memory to remember my preferences after rebootCons:- not tactile (no physical feedback for button presses... you have taken this for granted without realizing it)- has number pad (bad for mouse-heavy gaming)- lack of OLED display applications (due to price premium; seriously steelseries if you want this to catch on you need to integrate these into cheaper models of your keyboards)- profile switch + macro record button are not remappable (fixed functions)verdict: Don\'t buy this for the OLED display, it\'s near useless. Despite this, I believe that the switches are absolutely next generation. I can only hope that they release these switches, boards, and SDK for hobbyists so I can make a version with a better display/ expanded function and programmability. With absolute certainty, I can say that steelseries is working on a new version of this keyboard (likely with an upgraded or touch display). If you can wait, wait; but if you aren\'t afraid to ball out, go for it.I don\'t generally buy peripherals brand new, but headsets, keyboards, and mice are always worth it.TL;DR I\'ll probably buy this for my girlfriend when the new version drops. I only bought this because my old, bargain-bin keyboard has a dead, non hot-swappable switch (i.e. I needed a new keyboard anyway and definitely worth it to me on sale at about $175 after tax).Paired with: Steelseries Rival 5','2017-08-09 09:00:00',5,15,285),(821,'  This is a test of the typing on the Corsair K100. It seems very different from the K95 Platinum. I don\'t know if I enjoy it more or less than the previous version. I think it sounds a little clunky, but not too bad. The optic switches are insanely fast.I don\'t think there\'s a huge difference between 1000hz polling and 4000hz polling. I\'d like to think I can see a difference with my typing and gaming, but I really can\'t. I don\'t seem to have too much trouble finding the keys without looking at the keyboard, so that\'s a plus.  I also only really type with my thumb and two forefingers, so this keyboard seems to be better, as the keys are less spaced out than the k95 Platinum. The \"U\" key seems to give me a little trouble.The scroll weel is kinda pointless. I can\'t think of a real reason to use it, so it\'s just going to sit on my keyboard looking fancy. I think that if you already have the k95 Platinum, then you should stick with it, especially if you\'re thinking about getting the speed switches for the k100, as they are the exact same switches. The only reason I could see upgrading is for the optic switches, which are super touchy.Going into detail on the optic switches, I swore I wasn\'t going to notice a difference, but I did indeed notice a huge one. Luckily, I\'m already used to speed switches, so this won\'t be too hard to learn. Anyone used to any other switch should avoid this keyboard, unless you are willing to get used to the Speed or OPX switches.When I bought the k95, I was coming from Cherry MX Blues. Anyone with experience with the Blue switches will tell you that they have an extremely clicky actuation point. They have a 2.2mm travel distance with a bottom of 4.0mm and require 50 grams of force to activate. Speeds are a lot quicker. They actuate at 1.2mm with a 3.4mm total travel distance. The force is similar at 45 grams. So as you may guess, it took a long time to get used to the speed and weight at which the Speeds activated.Now, Corsair\'s OPX Switches take the Speeds a bit further. This is both impressive and intimidating, as the Cherry MX Speeds were previously considered the world\'s fastest mechanical switch. OPX actuates at just 1mm, which is insanely low. I can put my lightest touch, not bottoming out, on these switches and they actuate. I assume that, other than being optical and having a faster actuation point, that the rest is similar to the Speeds. I will say that due to how the keyboard and keys are built vs. the k95, typing is much louder on the k100. I would highly suggest some different or custom keycaps.It is a well-rounded keyboard that\'s just a bit pricey for what you get. I don\'t think the wrist rest is anywhere near as well made as the k95. I hope we get a version like the k95 for the k100 in the future. The keys themselves feel... thinner? I dunno. I don\'t think they are. The scroll wheel for audio definitely feels a little cheaper than it\'s previous version. It\'s also hella touchy, moreso than the k95, which was already a problem for me. The media keys feel a lot jankier and wobble, whereas they never did on the k95. This next one is just personal taste, but I think the glass piece on the top center of the keyboard is unneeded, and not very attractive. I don\'t see the point of it, other than to say it has glass to up the price for \"premium build materials\".I can\'t tell you much about the software. You\'ll have to familiarize yourself with the convoluted and over-complicated iCue software. I will say that after upgrading the firmware for the k100, it ported all my macros and lighting effects from the k95, which was a huge plus.If you read this to the bottom, thank you. It was a type test in Word that turned into a very lengthy review. I enjoyed typing on these switches so much that I just kept typing and typing. I will continue to update this review if I run into any problems.Edit 11/19: After about a month of owning this keyboard, there is a slight to glaring flaw, depending on which key this happens to. It\'s avoidable, but still extremely annoying for such a high priced product. The wrist rest will slide up with use over time. Eventually, this will push hard against the keys, either making them feel like they don\'t press, or making them stay down.I ran into this problem a little while ago, but that was when I was moving the keyboard around. This time it inched up by itself and held my alt key down. It was a pain figuring out why my keyboard wasn\'t typing. I seriously thought it broke. Turns out the left side of the wrist rest was pressed up against the left side keys.Corsair, if you read this, please make a K95-style wrist rest. I will gladly buy it over this memory foam nightmare you gave us.','2021-03-14 17:00:00',1,13,285),(822,'  Yes it can play crysis.','2021-01-05 23:30:00',3,17,285),(823,'  GARBAGE.

I do take issue with a couple things that I\'d like you to keep in mind.1) Cherry MX Silver switches are significantly more sensitive than I expected. I constantly fat-finger things when I\'m typing.  Sometimes I start turning left, only to realize that just the weight of my ring finger on \"a\" is activating it, when I don\'t even feel that I\'m pressing the key.2) The \"G#\" keys on the far left have messed up my muscle memory. I keep pressing \"G1\" when I mean to hit \"ESC\", and \"G6\" when I mean to hit \"CTRL\".These 2 issues get quite annoying, but I still like it, and will continue to work with it to build new muscle memory.For context, I changed to this keyboard from Mad Catz STRIKE7.UPDATE a week later: I give up.  Switched back to my Mad Catz. I will not be buying Cherry MX Silver in the future.I got over the G keys for the most part, but typing extra letters in every sentence got old quick.Also, not for nothing, iCue really realllly sucks. It is not intuitive, and doesn\'t load the profile you had last, so you have to open and set it every time you turn on your computer. Also, the profiles are saved on the software, not the board, so it\'s full and lifeless unless you\'re running iCue.  What is this, 1997?TL;DR - Cherry MX Silver too sensitive, iCue SUCKS, G-keys are poorly placed. I now have a $230 dust collector.','2014-05-20 05:30:00',5,19,285),(825,'  Gamers buy this keyboard, and what do gamers hate? Reflections, because they are very distracting. Gaming monitors have done away with reflective bezels for this very reason, so it really is quite frustrating and perplexing that Corsair, who is supposed to be the premium gaming peripheral company, would put a mirrored reflective strip at the top of the keyboard, reflecting everything from the monitor onto that strip. It just defies logic why it is there. Very surprised that the hour seems to be amateur hour over at Corsair, at least when it comes to this specific issue.My other gripe is the fact that we have to install 3rd party software to use the G  keys, how the hell is it that they couldn\'t incorporate this in iCUE itself? Most of us already have enough pieces of software on our systems running in the background competing for resources.Other than those things, the keyboard is comfortable, beautiful, sturdy, and the keys feel fantastic (optical version). It sounds like a machine gun when you type, I personally like that, but it may throw some folks off.Would be 5 stars if not for those 2 things.','2014-01-11 02:00:00',5,19,285),(826,'  My first impression is that this thing is just absolutely gorgeous once its all plugged in. The aluminum construction, lightniing fast keycaps, and customizable  cue wheel make this thing just an absolutely awesome keyboard.I had never used MX Cherry \'short\' switches before, and they have more of a mooshy feel than they do a \'snappy\' feel than MX Browns, but I have to admit, after practicing a little bit I like them better than the browns. The short action requires very little effort to actuate, and it ends up adjusting your typing style from a tapping style to a gliding one. I can still burst up to 150WPM easily, which I was only able to achieve using my Das Keyboard Ultimate.It\'s a little expensive. I just happen to be fairly prosperous right now, so I splurged a bit. I imagine to the ordinary consumer looking for a \'dollar per feature\' comparison might find themselves better luck with an off-brand.We\'ll see how this thing holds up to the test of time, but right now I\'m in keyboard heaven.  Thanks Corsair!','2014-02-18 06:00:00',5,3,285),(827,'  TLDR: Premium keyboard loaded with features in a package as solid feeling as it looks.Pros:- Excellent build quality- Smooth optical switches- Up to 8k polling rate (to further take advantage of the optical switches)- Excellent sounding stabilizers right out of the box!- Very nice included wrist rest- Macro (G-key) streamdeck integration- Fully remappable (except for the icue button on the top left)- Double shot PBT keycaps- Standard Bottom row (can use just about any key cap set you want)- Bright RGB lighting with many preset effects and customization (can layer up to 20 effects)- Compatible with iCUE nexus- Can save lighting effects, macros, and profiles directly to the keyboardCons:- The included wrist rest\'s geometric pattern locks in grime quite easilyThoughts:Everything about this keyboard screams PREMIUM and QUALITY! Typing feels fantastic with the new OPX mechanical switches. They\'re smoother than cherry (as are pretty much everything these days) and sound great on the board. The stabilizers feel absolutely fantastic! No rattles at all. Finally! The worst part about corsair keyboards in the past (in my opinion) were the stabilizers. There was nothing you could do to those stupid wires to make them tolerable. The OPX mechanical switches are \"speed\" switches, meaning that they have a higher actuation point than switches you may be used to. Regular reds or linears actuate at about 2mm, where these actuate at 1mm. If you\'re not used to speed switches, you may make a lot of typos or walk off of cliffs alot for a while, but after getting used to them, you can hardly tell they\'re as high actuating as they are. The lighting is very bright and beautiful. I recently tried Razer\'s new huntsman analog, and nothing about it can hold a candle to this keyboard. If you\'re trying to decide between the two, there\'s absolutely no competition there. The wheel in the top left can do various things like adjust lighting, or scrub through music or videos. It\'s a nice little addition. The volume control is also very tight feeling. I\'ve felt many keyboards with dedicated volume wheels that feel real loose, but this one\'s very nice.Conclusion:This is as good of a gaming keyboard as you can get right now. It is absolutely loaded with features in a package that feels as solid as it looks. While being fairly pricy, you definitely get what you pay for with this. I highly recommend getting the optical switches since the other selection is a cherry speed switch anyway. The OPX switch feels great and better takes advantage of the 8k polling rate available on the board (not that mega high polling rates REEEALLY make a huge difference on keyboards). That said, I would recommend the OPX switch over the cherry speed switch because its just a much smoother feeling switch. If you\'ve ever used anything besides cherry, you know everything\'s better than cherry and that\'s no exception here. The cherry switches are very scratchy through their actuation. The OPX switches make a sort springy sound sometimes, usually on rapid presses, but nothing that you feel, so it\'s not enough to recommend against it. The OPX switches also feel lighter, probably because they\'re so much smoother which just feels much better in games.*update 3/16/2021:Corsair has released a new version of iCue that is much more modern, easy to use, and not bad to look at. It\'s more responsive when making changes and adds 8k polling rate to the K100.','2021-12-19 23:16:51',1,6,285),(828,'  So far I\'m loving this keyboard. I\'ve been a loyal Logitech fan for over two decades now and I gotta say it was a tough choice to switch brands after so long. I bought this to replace my G910 which had caps that had broken off and a few keys were starting to false trigger... lots of W\'s while typing, guess from all that gaming WASD pressing.Pros:These keys are pretty amazing. I got the MX Speed version and coming from Roamer G keys, they feel so much more responsive and I feel I can press them faster, they also feel sturdier, but that I can say about overall the keyboard itself. This aluminum body makes it feel solid. The wrist wrest is super comfy, I didn\'t know it was memory foam until I got it, you know it\'s one of those things I really didn\'t bother reading about while doing research. The texture on the key caps is also a nice detail. Volume wheel feels super sturdy too, same with the new Control Wheel.Cons:I\'m not a super fan of their iCUE software. I was trying to setup some macros similar to how I had them on my G910 and spent like 5 mins trying to find how to set the name on one of the Actions I had just created... And then another 10 trying to find how to assign the action to one of the G keys... had to watch a video on their website to realize you have to click on the Action and then click on the Key... Guess I got used to the way it\'s done in the Logitech Gaming Software, which you either right click the key and have a context menu, or you drag and drop an existing Command to a key... a bit more intuitive and user friendly. The software itself feels a bit sluggish, but it\'s not something I\'m going to spend on lots of hours on after I setup my macros and profiles. I do like that I pretty much have as many key assignments as Profiles I create, and also (haven\'t done it yet) but seems you can remap any key, which you couldn\'t do on the Logitech ones.','2021-12-19 23:16:52',5,14,285),(829,'  I bought this keyboard in December 2020. And it came with a two-year \"warranty\"It was a great keyboard until it wasn\'t. In fact, I got about 8 months great use out of it.A few days ago the secondary enter key (near the number pad) became sluggish and started to not return to the full return height. It got progressively worse after another day or two where it would not come back up at all after being pressed.I contacted Corsair for warranty repair or replacement. I was shocked when I saw the curt response from their \"customer service\" representative Reno who stated and I quote:\"This type of damage is not covered by our warranty\".WTFFirst off there was no damage cause by me. This is a switch malfunction.  Perhaps 90 percent of any keyboard is comprised of switches and they are not covered by the warranty?  This is just laughable. Paying about $200 paid for a keyboard that I got 8 months of use out of, is insane, and what\'s more insane is that Corsair will not stand behind their product and warranty.I have been a Corsair customer for years and use and used  many of their products. I have never before had an issue with any of their gear until now.  But I guess I was lucky.And knowing what a sham their warranty is, at least with respect to keyboards, I will certainly think twice about buying any more Corsair products.  Wait, I won\'t think twice. Once is enough. I am done with Corsair.Buyer beware.A copy of their actual response to my warranty ticket is attached.','2021-12-19 23:16:53',4,15,294),(830,'  I\'ve owned tons of Corsair\'s previous keyboards starting with their early monocolor white led k95 to the various other iterations of the K70 and K95 that were released over the years. I\'ve always had some issue with them that made me hope that it would be fixed. The first K95 had problems with the black on the keycaps wearing off and the led lights dying quickly. Later RGB versions seemed to fix the LEDs dying, but introduced issues with a single key press registering multiple keystrokes. Then the quality of the keycaps of newer releases seemingly degraded and were completely loose out of the box. So loose that if you tapped a key too quickly, the keycap would fly off the board. That got old very quickly. Then the K95 RGB Platinum also had the issue of some of the LEDs starting to become really dim compared to the other keys. I switched to the EVGA Z20 after I got fed up with the various issues, but found it had its own host of problems including random disconnecting from the computer and losing power regardless of what USB port I plugged it into.I discovered that Corsair had a new keyboard with a new type of optical switches and decided to give their keyboards one more chance. After some months of use, I have to say this keyboard is fantastic so far and all my previous issues with their keyboards appear to be gone.- The keys feel just right when typing.- The fonts used on the keyboard look a lot better and the keyboard overall has a classier look to it.- The keycaps are not loose in the slightest. They are snugly fitted to the switches and actually takes a bit of effort to pull them off so I\'m not worrying about them flying off the keyboard anymore mid-game or while chatting.- There hasn\'t been a single instance of a single keypress registering multiple keystrokes. So far, the LEDs for these OPX switches have been holding up over the months and I hope they stay that way.- The keycaps are double shot so I don\'t have to worry about the paint on the keys coming off.- Not really a past issue per se, but perhaps due to the new OPX switches, it\'s not as loud when the keys bottom out while typing compared to the Cherry MX switches. An improvement in my opinion, but some people might prefer the louder clickety clack of the Cherry MX switches.As an added bonus, the wrist rest is also their best yet. It must use a memory foam inside as it has yet to flatten out even after applying a lot of pressure on like resting my elbows on it frequently. It\'s a huge improvement over the hard plastic wrist rests with the rubberized coating. It also conveniently snaps right onto the keyboard with magnets.If I were to list any cons, they would be:- Price. This is one expensive keyboard. I have had no issues with it so far, so I\'ll take it over having a cheaper keyboard with problems.- Easy to accidentally press a key if you\'re not careful as they are linear and don\'t require a whole lot of force. Also, they have a VERY short actuation distance.- I find the scroll wheel to only be mildly useful, but that\'s just my based on my own needs and usage.','2021-12-19 23:16:54',5,15,294),(831,'            Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n        \n\n\n   To premise this review, I am a mechanical keyboard enthusiast and not a gamer. I looked for a long time before I bought this keyboard because I was looking for the specific qualities of a 107-key layout, volume rocker, usb pass through, and the ability to swap out for third-party keycaps, in particular the ones I had laying around. If you\'re looking for all those things, this is a really great buy. Plus the LED screen and the \'apps\' included with the Steam Engine 3 software are really fun. I have one that shows me the song playing on spotify on my LED, and I think it\'s great.Regarding a full keycap replacement, this one was perfect for me. If you look at other brands, be careful of their bottom row, I saw a lot with small Fn or Windows keys and I wanted to replace ALL the keys with a full set.I am very satisfied with this keyboard in terms of its functionality, colors, and overall build. However, a small nitpicky issue I have is that version of browns is quite loud. Coming from gateron browns (which I lubed), this had more of a \'ping\' sound that irked me. Therefore, I decided to treat this mechanical keyboard the way I do with my smaller ones --- take it apart and insert some felt below the pcb. I also lubed the key switches and stabilizers. Unfortunately this didn\'t change the sound at all. I didn\'t want to use o-rings because I don\'t like how they feel.I originally had the hyperx pudding keycaps on this board because I wanted to take advantage of the RGB, but the sound seemed to echo in it, perhaps because it was thinner around the edges. Still wanting see the RGB in all its glory, I took out another set I had laying around --- some Thick Outlined ABS keycaps that I had bought from Massdrop. I never felt like this set fit in with my other keyboards, but I am happy to report it found its home. This set did the trick and change the sound to something heftier and slightly quieter. Gone was the springy sound before these mods.Of course I would not suggest that you make these changes unless you are comfortable (you may void your warranty). However, I\'m very pleased with this keyboard now. If I could replace the plastic bottom of the case, I think I could have something even more special. I\'ve included a sound test of me typing a 1-minute test. I average about 90 words per minute most of the time and this keyboard does not slow me down (nor make me faster).','2021-12-19 23:16:55',5,3,294),(832,'  I ended up going with the Apex 7 Brown version of the keyboard. I was coming from a Logitech G510 rubber dome keyboard.After using it for a while, I\'ve noticed a few things:The keys are a little bit higher, so my hand sits at a slightly different angle than I\'ve been used to for almost a decade; so that has been an adjustment. I never used the G510 wrist rest, and I currently don\'t have it on the Apex 7. I may need to start though because it does compensate a little bit for the shift in key height.Despite the description of the keyboard, the \"tactile/quiet\" doesn\'t quite accurately describe the sound. Playing games can be quiet if you\'re only using a smaller subset of the keys (WASD type deal) and press them less frequently, but if you are typing fast (or even average speed), the keys are noticeably louder than the rubber dome keys. I\'d say so much louder that I cant imagine the clicky keys on the blue is much louder when typing. My wife has complained about the loudness of my typing now that we share an office.In terms of key feel, I really like it compared to the rubber dome. I wouldn\'t say it is similar in feel by any means though. It takes less force to push a key down, but because it feels less \"mushy\" I feel like my typing is more precise. If you were to go with the clicky blue version, I\'d say you\'d get more of that \"key pressed\" feel you get on the rubber dome when you push past the force required to activate a key. On the brown switches, you can push a key slowly down and only feel a minor bump when activating the key.Having per-key color customization and profiles is a neat feature especially if you\'re going for A E S T H E T I C S on your build. Definitely an improvement over the G510 in terms of brightness and color definition.The inclusion of 6 macro keys is a nice carryover option from the G510, and I definitely didn\'t need 18 of those. Haven\'t really had an opportunity to use this feature yet, but it is nice that it is there.One feature I miss is having a clock on the LCD screen. I\'d say that as of now, the LCD screen is useless for my purposes with the current app options available. I currently just have a gif on it and the screen serves no functional purpose. The only apps available for the LCD screen from steel series are games I don\'t really play, or visualizers I won\'t ever use. If you want a clock, or to display song info (from things like spotify), you\'re going to have to find someone that has made it and install it manually, or code it yourself.The volume slider is exactly as it was on the G510 and I\'d say its even better since you get a little tactile bump each time you spin it. This is a feature I\'m glad is exactly the same.The single play/pause/skip key under the volume wheel took a little bit of getting used to, but works as intended. The only negative I\'d say is that unlike the G510, when you use the button to play/pause/skip and your monitor is asleep (but PC is still playing music in the background) it wakes your monitors up. The G510 buttons did not do this, and it is something I miss from that keyboard.Final thoughts is that this keyboard has enough features (that I wanted from my G510) to warrant the upgrade. It is a nice keyboard that should hopefully last me the next 10 years. The difference between brown and blue switches is probably just feel and not necessarily noise level (and the reds didn\'t interest me at all).','2021-12-18 19:29:38',5,16,294),(833,'  2 month review.  I got this for my home office and it works great. I\'ve used several mechanical keyboards over the years and this one is excellent. Some gaming keyboards are indeed great, but not for typing. I use this one as my keyboard for my job. I type on it for 8+ hours a day. The feel is a little heavy compared to membrane kbs, but I like that since I don\'t find myself accidentally activating keys by laying my fingers on the keys.It isn\'t a loud keyboard like the old school clickers, but in an office setting your cube mates could probably hear you fairly well. At home, my dog doesn\'t seem to be bothered by my typing. At the office, I have a mechanical Logi \"G\"-something that is also pretty darn good and more quiet. I would still take this SS Apex 7 as my #1 KB.The backlighting is nice by default. No need to install any software just to adjust/change the lighting from an annoying animation. By default, the colors are a spectrum that SLOWY scroll (top to bottom). When you type the keys turn white and white expands L&R from the key you pressed and across the row.  Not annoying compared to some other brand\'s default lighting behavior.','2021-12-19 23:16:57',1,8,294),(834,'  Updating my review after 8 months of use. Aug 13th, 2021After getting use to the feel of the keys I have come to realize this is the best keyboard I have ever owned.  This is comparing it to my Corsair K95 Platinum XT keyboard, my Razer BlackWidow, and my Logitech 710+.The ability to adjust the actuation of the key, the actual action of the keys, and the lack of noise when typing cannot be beat. You do not have the traditional mechanical feedback but it is obvious when a key actuates. I have never mistyped due to lack of tactile feedback.The ability to adjust when each of the primary keys activates it fantastic. When I game I rest my finger a little harder on the A key than the WSD keys. To compensate for this I simply changes the activation setting on the A key. Problem solved.They keyboard is very responsive. I do not feel like I have to type any differently on this keyboard vs any of my others.The lack of noise is great for working from home and when on comms for gaming.The ability to switch between profiles directly  that not only controls lighting but the key settings is great. I can work all day and then at the end of the day switch profiles directly from the keyboard is great.Yes, you may get a keyboard that is broken but if you can handle dealing with the return it is worth the trouble.The bad.The frame is aluminum so they must have a piece of ferrous metal inside the frame for the magnetic wrist rest to attach to. On my KB there is no ferrous metal on the left side so only the right side attaches. Frustrating.I picked the brown switches. They are defiantly quieter but feel like chicklet keys. Almost zero mechanical feedback to let you know the key actuated. This is after using reds for the last few years.The OLED display is basically useless since it sits flush with the KB. It needs to be raised at least a 1/2\" to really be useful.The good.The form factor is compact but still has a number pad.The KB feels well made. I expect it it to last a long time.The software is easy to use for the basic functions. Per key lighting, profiles, OLED display.Overall a nice KB but the too common issue of poor quality control is frustrating. I have to return my KB and there are none in stock from authorized sellers so I am not able to get a replacement. Very frustrating.','2021-12-19 23:16:58',4,16,294),(835,'  It\'s not even a full year, I never played games with this thing, I don\'t even use that machine much this keyboard connected to since I use consoles for gaming, yet the plastic keycaps are breaking and coming off!So much bragging about aerospace grade aluminium but what about the plastics you used for the caps?How about use normal material for the frame instead of your fake aerospace grade aluminium and put that money on abs plastic for the keys so that they at least last longer?Yes I dropped water on the keys and once dried, even after months, it\'s working but what\'s the point if the keys are falling apart? And don\'t preach that water damage is causing the plastic keys breakdown!And where is this product from? China or Taiwan?','2021-12-19 23:16:59',5,1,294),(836,'  I got the brown switches on the keyboard which I kind of instantly regretted, wishing I had gotten something a little more positively clicky. The blue switches maybe? idk. I\'ve never used a KB with these switches before so I was really just guessing. Also when I start typing fast it feels like some of the keys have some frictional resistance to them, like they\'re hitting the side of the housing or something. Maybe I\'m putting some lateral force on them or something idk. The keys and body feel like they\'re made out of premium materials, though, and the action feels really nice even though it\'s a bit off from what I prefer. I don\'t like how fat and chunky boi the body is, preferring Logitech\'s super slim design. I also didn\'t like the honkin\' 4AWG cable coming out the back for the dual USB and was wishing it was wireless. However, after using it for a few hours and getting somewhat used to it, I\'m pretty happy with it, functionally. Aesthetically, as well. Except for that cable, lol. I\'m going to re-arrange my office a bit though so I can get my Cintiq hooked up to my work PC, maybe I\'ll be able to hide the cable when I do. Overall, I like it enough to keep it for a few years, and at some point I\'ll probably get a new set of switches for it. 3/5','2020-09-10 03:00:00',1,18,294),(837,'  Disclaimer: I originally received the package empty because someone stole the keyboard before it was sent to me. It was a frustrating situation, but Amazon customer service followed up with me and refunded me by the next day, which I was happy with. I ended up buying the same model with brown switches the next day from the steel series store, and ended up saving $20 on the original $170 priced blue-switch keyboard.It\'s got a nice feel to it with both brown and blue switches, and has good resistance, but I prefer the brown over the blue because the clicking was a bit too loud for my taste. I like the OLED Display for it being customizable and can display the settings as well. I like the wrist rest as well, the material is comfortable on the wrist, but dust and other small particles, tend to stick to it easily, but nothing that can\'t be easily wiped off.The things I don\'t like is that the caps lock is easy too accidentally press, since it doesn\'t have any space between the A or Shift key, which some might like, but I don\'t. Also, when turning the LED lights off, the passthrough port and the media control button of the top right do not turn off. This can be annoying if you have this in a bedroom.Overall, I do recommend this keyboard if the above issues are not a problem.','2020-05-22 14:01:00',2,6,294),(838,'  I\'m redacting my original praising review for this keyboard because less than a year after purchase, an LED went bad, keys stopped working, and then it just straight up died on me.I thought Steel Series had finally turned themselves around as a brand when they started selling higher end equipment, but this combined with having replaced three of their mice and a $350+ dollar headset now being held together with Gorilla Glue, I\'ve pulled a complete 180 and no longer recommend anyone buy anything from this company until they get their act together.','2021-12-19 23:16:54',5,20,294);
